The number of students enrolling in engineering and technology courses in the country has seen a steady decline in recent years, falling to 39.2 lakh in 2020-21 from 45.4 lakh in 2014-15, according to official data.\\n\\nData from the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) published by the Ministry of Education was shared in Parliament by Minister of State for Education Subhas Sarkar in response to a question asked on the matter.\\n\\n&amp;quot;The slight downward trend in enrolment from 2011-12 to 2020-21 may be due to the changes in preferences of students and the introduction of new courses having alternative job opportunities,&amp;quot; he said, citing information from the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE).\\n\\n\\n\\nData from AISHE shows that Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Technology (B Tech) are the only major programmes at the undergraduate level that have seen a decline in enrolment.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the number of enrolments has declined, the number of colleges offering engineering courses has also come down, with several of them shutting down in recent years. The number of AICTE-approved technical and engineering colleges has declined 9.02 percent between 2017-18 and 2023-24.\\n\\n\\n\\nLack of employability\\n\\nAccording to data from the India Skills Report 2022, almost half of India&rsquo;s engineering undergraduates are not employable. The percentage of employable talent who completed BE or B Tech courses in 2022 stood at just 55 percent. Meanwhile, estimates by the World Economic Forum (WEF) show that only one in five engineering graduates from the country are employable.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoreover, according to a statement made by former vice chairman of NITI Aayog, Rajiv Kumar, as many as 48 percent of India&rsquo;s engineering graduates remain unemployed.\\n\\nDearth of suitable jobs\\n\\nA report by Aspiring Minds (now called SHL) shows that for most engineering graduates in India, finding the right company or profile to apply to is the biggest challenge in gaining employment, followed by clearing interviews.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough around 95 percent of students have taken some sort of training to improve their employability, most did it in college itself.\\n\\nMore alarmingly, as many as 59 percent of the students surveyed said that faculty members don&rsquo;t talk to them about the industry applications of concepts covered in the curriculum.\\n\\nThe difficulty in finding the right jobs to apply for seems to extend to premier institutes such as the IITs as well. According to a study by the Centre for Policy Studies at IIT Bombay, between 2014 and 2018, around 60 percent of graduates from the institute took up non-core jobs, which refers to jobs in fields other than their branch of study.\\n\\nThe majority of students from all branches, except Computer Science and Engineering and Electrical Engineering showed a stronger preference for non-core jobs.'], ['moneycontrol', \"What's behind the contrasting investment trends in multi-cap and flexi-cap funds?\", \"Multi-cap and flexi-cap funds, which invest across large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks, have been witnessing contrasting trends in investments over the past three months.\\n\\nAs per Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) data for July, multi-cap funds witnessed net inflows worth Rs 2,500 crore while flexi-cap funds saw outflows to the tune of Rs 932 crore.\\n\\nFurther, over the last three months, multi-cap funds have seen investments of Rs 3,340 crore while flexi-cap funds saw net selling of Rs 1,317 crore.\\n\\nBoth multi-cap and flexi-cap funds work under the same mandate of investing across market capitalisations, albeit to different degrees. What&rsquo;s behind the difference in their fortunes?\\n\\n\\n\\nNew funds\\n\\nMutual fund houses in India have increased their focus on multi-cap funds in the recent past. Data available with AMFI shows that over the last year, there have been seven new fund offers (NFOs) of multi-cap funds, and four of flexi-cap funds. But why is that?\\n\\nIn 2020, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced new norms for multi-cap funds, mandating a minimum of 25 percent allocation each to large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks.\\n\\nAlso read |&nbsp;RBI MPC: Das calls for greater transparency to floating-rate loan borrowers\\n\\nSoon after, the capital markets regulator launched a &ldquo;flexi-cap&amp;quot; category, which didn&rsquo;t have restrictions on investing in large-, mid-, or small-cap stocks.\\n\\nConsequently, most funds moved to the flexi-cap category, while a few remained multi-cap.\\n\\nToday, there are 33 flexi-cap funds while the count of multi-cap funds increased to 18 as of July, with new fund launches.\\n\\nData shows that since January 2023, NFOs of multi-cap funds have collected total funds of Rs 4,439 crore, while flexi-cap NFOs have raised Rs 964 crore.\\n\\nThe multi-cap fund launches is one reason behind positive inflows into this category.\\n\\nAllure of smaller-caps\\n\\nData shows that on an average, flexi-cap funds combined are 23 percent into mid-cap and small-cap stocks, against 55 percent by multi-cap funds.\\nThis higher exposure to smaller-caps has resulted in a better performance by multi-cap funds.\\n\\n\\n\\nData shows that over the past year, while flexi-cap funds have risen 15 percent, multi-cap funds have gone up 20 percent, resulting in higher investor interest in the latter category.\\n\\nAlso read |&nbsp;3 RBI announcements that will turbocharge UPI, UPI Lite\\n\\n&ldquo;The performance that mid-cap and small-cap spaces have given predominantly post COVID is probably prompting a lot of investors to consider multi-cap funds,&rdquo; said Harshad Chetanwala, co-founder of MyWealthGrowth.\\n\\nMind the risk\\n\\nOn the face of it, the multi-cap and flexi-cap categories might look similar as they both invest across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks. However, the regulatory mandate on their exposure to different market-caps makes them very different and changes their risk profiles.\\n\\n&ldquo;There is no comparison between a flexi-cap and a multi-cap fund. Flexi-cap funds are pseudo large-cap funds, with one or two exceptions. On the other hand, multi-cap funds are a pure market-cap diversification category,&rdquo; said Kirtan Shah, founder of Credence Wealth Advisors.\\n\\nIn the flexi-cap category, fund managers have the flexibility to change market-capitalisation exposure based on their view of where the market is heading, an option that is not available to multi-cap funds.\\n\\n&ldquo;This increases the risk element. In the last few years, mid-caps and small caps have generated better returns, but these are the places where the volatility could also be higher, plus large-caps are more or less stable. Further, I don't see interest in the flexi-cap category from investors reducing,&rdquo; said Chetanwala.\\n\\nAlso read |&nbsp;RBI&rsquo;s worry on inflation can impact debt funds. Here is what investors should do\\n\\nMeanwhile, Shah suggests that most investors need to stick to the large-cap and flexi-cap categories. &ldquo;If at all somebody has some risk appetite, some allocation to information technology, pharma and BFSI (Banking, Financial Services and Insurance) funds will do well,&rdquo; he added\\n\\nKeep in mind that in any circumstance, a 50 percent combined allocation in mid-caps and small-caps would be riskier than a flexi-cap fund and even a large and mid-cap fund.\"], ['moneycontrol', 'TVS Supply Chain Solutions IPO: Can the logistics major tower over peers?', 'After almost 29 years, a TVS group company is heading for an initial public offering (IPO). On August 7, TVS Supply Chain Solutions announced that its IPO will be open for bidding from August 10 to August 14. The last TVS Group company to be listed was TVS Electronics in 1994.\\n\\nTVS Supply Chain Solutions began operations as a part of the group under the name TVS Logistics before becoming a separate company in 2004.\\n\\nToday, TVS Supply Chain Solutions, or TVS SCS, as a global supply chain company, provides end-to-end solutions to Fortune 500 companies across the world. The business is divided into two main components: Integrated Supply Chain Solutions and Network Solutions.\\n\\nALSO READ: TVS Supply Chain Solutions IPO records 36% booking on debut\\n\\nUnder Integrated Supply Chain Solutions, the company provides technology-based solutions for sourcing and procurement, integrated transportation, product management solutions, logistics operation centres and in-plant logistics such as finished goods and after-market fulfilment among others.\\n\\nUnder Network Solutions, it provides two types of services: Global Freight Solutions and Time Critical Final Mile Solutions, which include a variety of services such as spare parts logistics services, return, refurbishment and engineering support and courier services to B2B businesses, both large and small.\\n\\nTranslated, what this means is that, a manufacturing company, after having recognised its suppliers and customers, need not bother about how to get things &ldquo;moving.&rdquo; It can outsource the entire operations to TVS Supply Chain, which will pick up the raw material from anywhere in the world and get it to delivered to the company&rsquo;s factories, and pick up finished good and deliver to its customers, be it in India or abroad. All the works along the way, be it warehousing or booking containers for transport, or taking care of custom clearances, the company will take care of everything.\\n\\nNow, we know India is likely to grow exports big-time, thanks to government&rsquo;s thrust and global companies&rsquo; push to diversify their sourcing base beyond China, widely termed as a China-plus-one strategy. This obviously means more business for a company like TVS Supply Chain.\\n\\nOn solid ground\\n\\nAnalysts believe the company has the competitive strength to provide end-to-end supply-chain solutions. So far, the company has grown largely through acquisitions, about 16 acquisitions over the past 17&nbsp; years.&nbsp; Thus, it has both the domain expertise, and the global presence, which means it can replicate the know-how to future customers operating in a variety of geographies and industries.\\n\\nCurrently, TVS SCS has clientele in 26 countries across Europe, Asia (including India) and Australia.\\n\\nAccording to a report by HDFC Securities, with the use of integrated, data-driven, end-to-end solutions, the company has been able deliver value to customer and gain their trust. This has mean high rate of repeat customers, which ensures a steady flow of business from existing customers, even as the company focusses on new customer additions.\\n\\n&ldquo;Our unit of measure is a project or a contract; how many contracts do we have, what is the longevity of these contracts, and what is our renewal ability&hellip;We have a renewal rate of around 99 percent, and it is our ability to win new contracts, which is the focus,&rdquo; Ravi Viswanathan, Managing Director, TVS SCS, told Moneycontrol during a recent interaction. Recently, it added UK-based Centrica plc to its roster for &ldquo;supply chain transformation&rdquo;. Like most of its deals, TVS signed the Centrica deal for 7 years plus.\\n\\nDiversified portfolio\\n\\nWhile the business opportunity for TVS is huge, and it has a replicable model in place, by the very nature of its business, it won&rsquo;t be immune to any headwinds in global trade, say analysts. This is what the Covid period showed. During Covid, the company&rsquo;s revenue hardly grew and the business made losses. Only in FY23, it could get back in the green with a profit of Rs 10,311.01 crore.\\n\\nWhat saves the day for the company in bad times though is the fact that it has a diversified portfolio. Any slump in one particular industry or country may be off-set by growth in the others. &ldquo;The global supply chains were impacted and so were many of our customers like electronic components and auto manufacturers. Thankfully, our portfolio is fairly diverse. So we were able to manage the business effectively,&rdquo; it said. Currently, about 50 percent of TVS SCS business comes from manufacturing; 30 percent comes from non-auto and 20 percent comes from auto. Non-auto businesses include electronics, mining, alternate power, technology and consumer goods while within auto it supports both production and the after-markets. &ldquo;In many ways, our business model is a de-risked one. In spite of very strong economic headwinds in the western markets because of the war and inflation, last fiscal our business grew,&rdquo; the management recently told Moneycontrol.\\n\\nCapital intensity\\n\\nThe past three fiscal years for which its financials are available, the company clocked losses in two years. Last fiscal, it recorded a net profit of Rs 41.7 crore as against a loss of Rs 73.9 crore in FY21. EBIDTA margin for FY23 stood at 6.68 percent. Return ratios were also unimpressive with ROE at 5.50&nbsp;percent and ROCE at 7.64 percent.\\n\\n .\\n\\nThe financial numbers at this point do not point to a very profitable business, although the management boasts of an &lsquo;asset-light&rsquo; model and says that it is striving for a double digit EBIDTA by in the next few years. Being asset-light means that the company does not own any its fleet, containers or warehouse space, all of which is great because it means the capital requirement for the business is not too much. It leases warehouses and vehicles and has complete control over control over the capacity and fleet. The scheduling, routing, storing, and delivery of goods are managed by the company, which enables it to maintain control over operational quality metrics while keep things flexible to suit customer requirements.\\n\\nYet, the asset-light model is largely seen as a good model, a HDFC Securities report says that the company&rsquo;s high dependency on third parties and network partners for warehousing and transformation, could impact operations, financials and cash flows. Besides, the company&rsquo;s freight, clearing, forwarding and handling charges, and manpower expenses (comprising employee benefit expenses, sub-contracting costs and casual labour charges) constitute a significant portion of its operating expenses, which means any increase due to any internal or external factors may also adversely affect kits financials. While these are usually passed on to the clients, it may not always be possible, and depends on what the contracts provide for. Another challenge HDFC Securities points out is its exposure to foreign currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency could impact both its revenue and borrowings.\\n\\nIndia opportunities\\n\\nWhile a lot of its presence is international, the growing supply chain market in India and the absence of a large-scale player of its size could be of advantage for TVS SCS in the domestic market, and most analysts believe that&rsquo;s what makes the company stand out is its diverse set of services with no like-to-like peer in the market. Currently, a large portion of the third-party logistics market in India is highly disorganised.\\n\\n\\n\\nNirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom, said, &ldquo;TVS SCS has the edge of large institutional clients, scale and expanse and the ability to provide end-to-end solutions which no other company does. This definitely has its advantages, including ease in creating synergies across different points in the supply chain process.&rdquo;\\n\\nIndeed, the logistics industry in India is expected to grow to $385 billion by FY2027 at a CAGR of 13 percent from FY2022 driven by favourable macroeconomic factors, growth of outsourcing in the Indian logistics sector, and government policies encouraging manufacturing and consumption such as the PLI scheme. Over the last couple of years, on the back of the China Plus One strategy by global companies, the government has been encouraging domestic manufacturing. Analysts believe this could be an additional advantage for the segment.\\n\\nIPO in focus\\n\\nTVS SCS had initially announced its intention for an IPO last year but it was reported that this was postponed keeping market conditions and investor sentiments in mind. Through the IPO, the company, which is being valued at Rs 9,200 crore, plans to raise around Rs 600 crore from fresh issue as against Rs 2,000 crore decided earlier. The funds raised, according to the company, will play an important role in helping it overcome past challenges associated with debt. Similarly, it has cut its offer-for-sale to 14.23 million shares from 59 million shares planned earlier. The fixed price band for its initial public offering is Rs 187-197. At the higher end of the issue price, the company is valued at a market-cap of Rs 8,750 crore. The issue is priced at 10.5 times based on its net asset value of Rs 18.89 as of Mar 2023.\\n\\nConsidering the company&rsquo;s pedigree with the TVS group, which is seen as a shareholder-friendly group, and the tremendous growth opportunity, the stock seems to have the potential to ride the growth wave and create wealth over the long haul. But in the short to medium term, this may not be a great bet. Karkera says he sees good potential for the stock, amongst larger institutional investors. &ldquo;The sector warrants a lot of institutional interest and these investors are willing to take a longer-term risk on the sector which is in an expansion mode,&rdquo; he said.'], ['moneycontrol', \"Hike's Rush Gaming Universe axes 55 jobs as 28% GST bites\", \"Rush Gaming Universe, a casual skill gaming platform from Kavin Bharti Mittal's Hike, is laying off around 55 employees, of which 24 are non-full time employees.

But excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation matched the smallest monthly increase in nearly two years. The inflation figure the government reported Thursday showed that consumer prices increased 3.2% from a year earlier. That was up from a 3% annual rise in June, which was the lowest rate in more than two years.\\n\\nThe July inflation figure remained far below last year&rsquo;s peak of 9.1%, though still above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s 2% target. The Fed, economists and investors, though, pay particular attention to the core inflation figures for signs of where inflationary pressures might be headed. From June to July, core inflation remained a tame 0.2%. Thursday&rsquo;s price data will be among the key barometers the Fed will weigh in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates.\\n\\nIn its drive to tame inflation, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate 11 times since March 2022 to a 22-year high. A jump in energy prices has rekindled some of the inflation pressures underlying the economy. Gasoline prices have surged nearly 30 cents over the past month to a national average of $3.83 a gallon, according to AAA. Economists say that in the fight to conquer inflation, easy progress has likely already been achieved. Gasoline prices, for example, though liable to bounce around from month to month, have already plunged from a peak national average of more than $5 a gallon, which was reached in June of last year after Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nMuch of the inflationary surge that began in 2021 was caused by clogged supply chains: Ports, factories and freight yards were overwhelmed by the explosive economic rebound from the pandemic recession of 2020. The result was delays, parts shortages and higher prices. But supply-chain backlogs have eased in the past year, sharply reducing upward pressure on goods prices.\\n\\nPrices of long-lasting manufactured goods actually dipped in June. Now, the Fed faces a daunting problem: persistent inflationary pressures in service businesses &mdash; restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues and the like &mdash; where wages represent a substantial share of costs. Worker shortages have led many of these services companies to sharply raise pay. Last week, for example, the Labor Department reported that average hourly wages rose 4.4% in July from a year earlier, more than expected.\\n\\nTo cover their higher labor costs, companies have typically raised their prices, thereby fueling inflation. Another factor working against continued declines in year-over-year inflation rates is that prices soared in the first half of last year before slowing in the second half. So any price increase in July would have the effect of boosting the year-over-year inflation rate. Still, economists caution against reading too much into one month of numbers.\\n\\nMany of them expect inflation to continue trending lower. Used car prices, which had skyrocketed after the pandemic, have been edging down: They dropped 5.1% in July from a year earlier to $29,198, according to Edmunds.com. July of last year was near the peak of used-car price spikes, resulting from a scarcity of new vehicles caused by a global computer-chip shortage. Buyers who wanted new vehicles but couldn&rsquo;t find them entered the used market, sending used prices sharply higher.\\n\\nThis year, though, used vehicle prices began to drop once automakers managed to acquire more chips and could produce more new vehicles. Many shoppers who were forced to buy used are now back in the new-vehicle market. Used-vehicle prices are expected to decline, at least modestly, through the year. Despite chronic concerns about higher labor costs, one closely watched measure of wages and salaries &mdash; the Labor Department&rsquo;s employment cost index &mdash; grew more slowly from April through June.\\n\\nExcluding government jobs, employee pay rose 1%, less than the 1.2% increase in the first three months of 2023. Compared with a year earlier, wages and salaries grew 4.6%, down from a year-over-year increase of 5.1% in the first quarter. Rents, which had soared after the pandemic, are also cooling. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote this week that &amp;quot;year-over-year shelter inflation will continue to slow through late 2024 and may even turn negative by mid-2024.&amp;quot;\\n\\nFed officials will have plenty of data to absorb before deciding whether to continue raising rates. Thursday&rsquo;s report is the first of two CPI numbers the policymakers will see before their next meeting on Sept. 19-20. In addition, their favoured inflation gauge, called the personal income expenditures price index, comes out on Aug. 31. And the August jobs report will be released on Sept. 1. Many economists and market analysts think the Fed&rsquo;s most recent rate hike in July will prove to be its last: Nearly 87% of traders expect no Fed hike next month, according to the CME Group&rsquo;s FedWatch Tool.']], [['moneycontrol', \"Japan's BoJ miscommunicates with easy money policy under pressure\", \"With few exceptions, the most prominent central banks have retired from the business of providing detailed projections of where interest rates are headed.

In this context, experts advise investing in debt funds investing in bonds, maturing in the short term.\\n\\nInflation remains a key concern\\n\\nThough inflation came down to 4.3 percent in May 2023, the inflation numbers are expected to be higher in July and August. Food prices remain a key variable and can push up inflation. The possibility of El Nino impacting the distribution of rains, and, thereby, farm output, can further push up prices. Globally, food and crude oil prices have inched up. Price of brent crude oil went to $87 per barrel on August 10, 2023, from $72 per barrel on May 31, 2023. These indicate a possibility of upward movement in inflation numbers.\\n\\nALSO READ: 3 RBI announcements that will turbocharge UPI, UPI Lite\\n\\nAccordingly, the RBI has revised the inflation expectation for FY 2023-2024 to 5.4 percent, which was set at 5.1 percent in the June MPC review. &ldquo;We have to stand in readiness to go beyond, keeping Arjuna&rsquo;s eye on the inflation front, deploying policy instruments, if necessary. I reiterate what I said in my June policy statement: bringing headline inflation within the tolerance band is not enough; we need to remain firmly focused on aligning inflation to the target of 4 percent,&rdquo; the Governor said in his address announcing the MPC review outcome.\\n\\nAs a temporary measure to deal with excess liquidity in the banking system, the RBI has also directed scheduled banks to maintain an incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19, 2023 and July 28, 2023. This will be done, effective from the fortnight beginning August 12, 2023. This will be reviewed on September 8, 2023 or earlier. The governor further maintained that the existing cash reserve ratio (CRR) remains unchanged at 4.5 percent and there will be adequate liquidity in the system to meet the credit needs of the economy.\\n\\nALSO READ: What NRIs must keep in mind when investing their money\\n\\nHow does that impact debt fund investors?\\n\\nThe RBI&rsquo;s commitment to control inflation indicates that it is in no hurry to cut interest rates. The bond yields are expected to remain at the current higher levels for a longer period. Deepak Agrawal, CIO, Fixed Income, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company, says: &ldquo;The RBI prefers to be in a &lsquo;wait-and-watch&rsquo; mode to check if the recent food price inflation is getting generalised and prefers to keep rates on hold and to keep the monetary policy unchanged. The rate is likely to stay on hold for the rest of CY2023.&rdquo;\\n\\nIf the RBI reverses the I-CRR by September, with a view to infusing liquidity in the September review or earlier, then that should soften short-term bond yields, other things remaining the same.\\n\\nShort-term bond yields in a sweet spot\\n\\nThe benchmark 10-year bond yield remained flat at 7.17 after the MPC announcement. This may go up by a bit, if inflation actually goes up, as Das said the RBI expects.\\n\\nHere is why short-term bond funds are comparatively less impacted than long-term bond funds. Investments in long-duration bonds expose investors to interest rate risk. When compared to this, short-term bonds appear attractive as one and two-year bond yields quote around 7 percent.\\n\\nDharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist, CRISIL, says, &ldquo;Mint Road seems staunchly focused on keeping consumer inflation within the 4 percent target, while standing pat on rates and monetary policy stance.

Instead, this could be an opportunity to look at debt schemes focusing on the shorter end of the yield curve.\\n\\nWhat should you do?\\n\\nAccording to the monthly data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), liquid and money market funds saw net inflows of Rs 51,938 crore and Rs 8,608 crore, respectively.\\n\\nAfter witnessing a net outflow of Rs 14,135 crore in June (the end of the quarter), debt-oriented schemes received a robust net inflow of Rs 61,400 crore in July. This clearly highlights that investors are more comfortable investing at the short end of the yield curve. This can be a good time to invest in short-duration debt funds, if you intend to hold your investments for 2-3 years. For those looking to invest for less than a year, investments in liquid, low-duration and money-market funds can be considered. Such schemes can help investors to take advantage of the current high yields.
