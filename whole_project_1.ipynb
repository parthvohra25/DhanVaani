A year ago, the rate averaged 5.22%.\\n\\nIt&rsquo;s the third consecutive weekly increase for the average rate, which now matches its high for the year set on July 13. High rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, limiting how much they can afford in a market already unaffordable to many Americans.\\n\\n&ldquo;There is no doubt continued high rates will prolong affordability challenges longer than expected, particularly with home prices on the rise again,&amp;quot; said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac&rsquo;s chief economist. &amp;quot;However, upward pressure on rates is the product of a resilient economy with low unemployment and strong wage growth, which historically has kept purchase demand solid.&rdquo;\\n\\nThe average rate on a 30-year mortgage remains more than double what it was two years ago, when it was just 2.87%. Those ultra-low rates spurred a wave of home sales and refinancing. The sharply higher rates now are contributing to a dearth of available homes, as homeowners who locked in those lower borrowing costs two years ago are now reluctant to sell and jump into a higher rate on a new property.\\n\\nThe lack of housing supply is also a big reason&nbsp;home sales are down 23% through the first half of this year.\\n\\nThe latest increase in rates follows an uptick in the 10-year Treasury yield, which climbed to 4.19% last week, it's highest level since early November. The yield, which lenders use to price rates on mortgages and other loans, was at 4.02% in midday trading Thursday.\\n\\nHigh inflation drove the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022, lifting the fed funds rate to the highest level in 22 years. Inflation has come down steadily since last summer, and many analysts believe the Fed has reached the end of its rate hikes.\\n\\nMortgage rates don&rsquo;t necessarily mirror the Fed&rsquo;s rate increases, but tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Investors&rsquo; expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Fed does with interest rates can influence rates on home loans.\\n\\nThe average rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with those refinancing their homes, rose to 6.34% from 6.25% last week. A year ago, it averaged 4.59%, Freddie Mac said.\"], ['moneycontrol', \"RBI's I-CRR will not cause any liquidity shortage for banks, say bankers\", \"The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) announcement of the Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR) is unlikely to create any liquidity shortage for the banking industry, which in turn could hinder the lending process, bankers told Moneycontrol on August 10. Bankers are drawing comfort from the assurance of RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das during the post-policy press conference that the central bank will remain nimble towards liquidity management and act on both sides, they added.\\n\\n&amp;quot;There is the availability of liquidity for credit. For that, I don't think there's any impact because banks have sufficient liquidity available,&amp;quot; said Ashwani Kumar, Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of UCO Bank.\\n\\nEarlier today, the central bank said that scheduled commercial banks have to maintain an incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19, 2023, and July 28, 2023. This was announced with the aim of managing the higher surplus liquidity sloshing about in the economy following the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system.\\n\\nOn May 19, the RBI announced the withdrawal of the Rs 2,000 note, allowing citizens to either exchange the note or deposit it in their accounts. On August 1, the central bank said that Rs 3.14 lakh crore worth of Rs 2,000 banknotes, or 88 percent in circulation, had returned to the banking system by July 31.\\n\\nHowever, some bankers said that if liquidity does not remain under control, then the RBI can extend the period.\\n\\n&amp;quot;We are looking at this as a temporary measure, and we hope it remains the same. If the liquidity system is not under control in the prescribed period that the central bank has said, we can expect the central bank to extend I-CRR imposition,&amp;quot; said Shekhar Bhandari, President of Global Transaction Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank.\\n\\nOn the earnings front, Kumar added that there will be little impact, if any, on bank earnings.\\n\\nAt his address, Governor Das highlighted that the central bank considered the imposition of I-CRR desirable in the interest of financial and price stability and that banks would have enough liquidity to do their lending operations.\\n\\n&amp;quot;The Incremental CRR was considered necessary in the background of the liquidity overhang. We considered it desirable in the interest of financial and price stability. It will also have an impact on inflation. It is a purely temporary measure,&amp;quot; Das said.\\n\\nNo impact on rates\\n\\nSuresh Khatanhar,&nbsp; Deputy Managing Director, IDBI Bank, said banks may not make any changes in their deposit or lending rates after the policy announcement.\\n\\nOn August 10, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) unanimously voted to leave the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent, Governor Das announced today.\\n\\nThe Standing Deposit Facility rate has also been retained at 6.25 percent. Also, both the Marginal Standing Facility rate and the Bank Rate have been retained at 6.75 percent.\\n\\n&amp;quot;We were expecting the repo rate to continue to pause, Ashwani Kumar added. From the perspective of the Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR), there is stability in interest rates. Some bands within one or two buckets may see some increase in interest rates, he said.\\n\\nThe RBI held interest rates unchanged for the third successive time in the current financial year.\\n\\nOn the RBI's decision to increase the transaction limit of UPI Lite to Rs 500 from Rs 200, bankers said the move will increase digitisation.\\n\\nLaunched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in September 2022, UPI Lite allows quick small-value transactions by optimising the processing resources of banks, thereby reducing transaction failures.\\n\\nIt allows users to conduct transactions of up to Rs 200 a day without the need for a pin codewhich has reduced the transaction time. While the transaction limit has been raised to Rs 500 now, the UPI Lite balance ceiling has been left unchanged at Rs 2,000 to contain the risks associated with the relaxation of two-factor authentication.\\n\\nUPI Lite is available on Paytm. The BHIM app, GooglePay, and other payment apps. Canara Bank, HDFC Bank, Indian Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, and Utkarsh Small Finance Bank are already live in UPI Lite.\"], ['moneycontrol', 'MC Explains | All you need to know about the Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio', 'The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on August 10 said that scheduled banks have to maintain an incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19 and July 28.\\n\\nThe central bank added that the existing cash reserve ratio (CRR) remains unchanged at 4.5 percent.\\n\\nSo, why this I-CRR? We will try and explain below.\\n\\nDifference between I-CRR and CRR\\n\\nI-CRR is similar to the CRR, wherein banks need to set aside a certain portion of their money with the RBI. They do not earn any interest on this. Likewise, with the I-CRR, banks need to set aside an additional 10 percent of the NDTL garnered between May 19 and July 28.\\n\\nWhy has the RBI announced the I-CRR?\\n\\nThe central bank has announced the I-CRR with an aim to manage the higher surplus liquidity sloshing about in the economy following the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system (after they were withdrawn from circulation).\\n\\n&ldquo;This measure is intended to absorb the surplus liquidity generated by various factors, including the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system,&rdquo; RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said at the press conference following the monetary policy committee meeting.\\n\\nIn the last few months, the liquidity in the banking system has risen sharply post the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 banknotes, the transfer of RBI&rsquo;s surplus to the government, an uptick in government spending, and capital inflows.\\n\\nTo mitigate this, the central bank has conducted various variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions of different tenures, but received a muted response from the banks, as they preferred holding on to the liquidity to avoid seeking funds later under the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF). The MSF allows banks to borrow from the RBI in emergencies at a rate higher than the repo.\\n\\nSince June, the central bank has conducted 16 VRRR auctions for Rs 18 lakh crore. However, banks parked only Rs 7,73,023 crore in these auctions.\\n\\nHow much money will be parked in I-CRR?\\n\\nDas said that per the RBI&rsquo;s internal calculations, a little over Rs 1 lakh crore will be parked in I-CRR, which will accordingly lower the surplus liquidity in the banking system, which currently stands at around Rs 2.11 lakh crore.\\n\\nAccording to Esha Khanna, Associate Professor, NMIMS Sarla Anil Modi School of Economics, this move may slightly tighten the liquidity situation in the short term and affect short-term call rates.\\n\\nHow will it impact systemic liquidity?\\n\\nMost money market dealers and experts said the I-CRR will have some impact on the banking system liquidity, but it will continue to be in surplus by over Rs 1 lakh crore for the next couple of months.\\n\\n&ldquo;An ICRR of 10 percent can take out a little over Rs1 lakh crore from the banking system. Despite this, the system liquidity will remain in surplus by more than Rs 1 lakh crore for the next 1-2 months,&rdquo; said Pankaj Pathak, Fund Manager-Fixed Income, Quantum AMC.\\n\\nBut the I-CRR will impact short-term rates, which may harden by 15-20 basis points (bps).\\n\\n&ldquo;We expect the short-term rates of money market instruments like treasury bills, call money rates, and commercial paper to increase by 15-20 bps in the near term,&rdquo; said Anil Gupta, Senior Vice President, Co-Group Head - Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA Ltd.\\n\\nWill it impact lending and deposit rates?\\n\\nExperts believe that there will be no major impact on the deposit and lending rates because the RBI Governor has said that the central bank will ensure there is adequate liquidity in the system.\\n\\n&ldquo;We will ensure there is enough liquidity in the system for banks to continue lending,&rdquo; Das said during the conference.\\n\\nWill RBI continue VRRR auctions?\\n\\nDas also clarified that even though the central bank has announced the I-CRR, VRRR auctions will continue to be the main tool for draining excess liquidity.\\n\\n&ldquo;VRRR (auctions) will continue,&rdquo; Das said, adding that the VRRR system will release about Rs 93,000 crore on August 10.'], ['moneycontrol', 'In Charts | The declining popularity of engineering courses', 'Engineering courses, which were once highly sought-after by students in India, seem to be losing their charm. The number of students enrolling in engineering and technology courses in the country has seen a steady decline in recent years, falling to 39.2 lakh in 2020-21 from 45.4 lakh in 2014-15, according to official data.\\n\\nData from the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) published by the Ministry of Education was shared in Parliament by Minister of State for Education Subhas Sarkar in response to a question asked on the matter.\\n\\n&amp;quot;The slight downward trend in enrolment from 2011-12 to 2020-21 may be due to the changes in preferences of students and the introduction of new courses having alternative job opportunities,&amp;quot; he said, citing information from the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE).\\n\\n\\n\\nData from AISHE shows that Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Technology (B Tech) are the only major programmes at the undergraduate level that have seen a decline in enrolment.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the number of enrolments has declined, the number of colleges offering engineering courses has also come down, with several of them shutting down in recent years. The number of AICTE-approved technical and engineering colleges has declined 9.02 percent between 2017-18 and 2023-24.\\n\\n\\n\\nLack of employability\\n\\nAccording to data from the India Skills Report 2022, almost half of India&rsquo;s engineering undergraduates are not employable.

According to a study by the Centre for Policy Studies at IIT Bombay, between 2014 and 2018, around 60 percent of graduates from the institute took up non-core jobs, which refers to jobs in fields other than their branch of study.\\n\\nThe majority of students from all branches, except Computer Science and Engineering and Electrical Engineering showed a stronger preference for non-core jobs.'], ['moneycontrol', \"Japan's BoJ miscommunicates with easy money policy under pressure\", \"With few exceptions, the most prominent central banks have retired from the business of providing detailed projections of where interest rates are headed. The costs of being wrong in an era of worrisome inflation were too great. Japan is trying something new: forward&nbsp;misguidance. Unsettling surprises are a feature of the choices the Bank of Japan has made over the past decade, rather than a bug. Dismantling ultra-loose money and the paraphernalia that has supported it means that communications accidents like the one&nbsp;that&nbsp;rocked global markets&nbsp;recently are bound to happen. If they were, indeed, an accident.\\n\\nInvestors should brace for more adventures on the road to less easy money. With inflation now off the floor &mdash;&nbsp;there are arguments about how much momentum prices have &mdash;&nbsp;the desired destination is likely an end to vigorous policing&nbsp;of&nbsp;yields on government bonds. And quite possibly, an end to negative official rates. That&nbsp;won't happen overnight, but the odds of a graceful exit are long. Market sensitivity to tweaks in BOJ policy is extreme because officials are seeking to directly manage the value of securities, rather than guide toward their view.\\n\\nFew BOJ watchers predicted Governor Kazuo Ueda would let long-term market rates increase at the conclusion of the July 27-28 meeting.&nbsp;Ueda had used&nbsp;a&nbsp;dovish tone earlier in July, affirming at the meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers in India that things were set to stay the same. &ldquo;Unless the premise is shifted, the whole story will remain unchanged,&rdquo;&nbsp;he&nbsp;said. Reports from inside the bank seemed to back this narrative; more than 80 percent of economists expected no policy change, even a tweak.\\n\\nThat was until 2 am, Tokyo time,&nbsp;on the morning of July 28, when a story&nbsp;in the Nikkei newspaper hinted that rates on 10-year Japanese government debt would be allowed to go over 0.5 percent. It was the second time in Ueda&rsquo;s short reign that Japanese media&nbsp;appeared&nbsp;to be in possession of information from inside the gathering.\\n\\nEven then, traders didn&rsquo;t have the full story, with the report carrying no mention of the 1&nbsp;percent ceiling. When the official announcement hit after an interminable wait &mdash; the BOJ&nbsp;still&nbsp;does not give a time in advance for when policy will be announced, leaving&nbsp;dealers&nbsp;fruitlessly refreshing screens &mdash; it confused the market with its mention of three different levels for the 10-year yield (&ldquo;around zero,&rdquo; a 0.5 percent &ldquo;range&rdquo; and the 1 percent &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; at which the bank would step in). Investors are still debating what the move means.\\n\\nThe July decision &ldquo;created too many interpretations, because it was just too complex and everybody understood it in a different way,&rdquo; former board member Sayuri Shirai said in an interview. &ldquo;I kind of expected that Ueda-san would be a bit clearer.&rdquo;\\n\\nIt&rsquo;s far from the first time the bank has struggled to communicate a change in yield-curve control. In fact, every single time the&nbsp;BOJ&nbsp;has changed the way it implements YCC, it has done so&nbsp;differently, going from an ambiguous range to a defined one, and now back to ambiguity.\\n\\nIn an era when communications are a central bank&rsquo;s foremost tool, the data-driven Ueda was meant to bring clarity. The shock-and-awe strategy of his&nbsp;predecessor, Haruhiko Kuroda, was deliberately designed to stun the market and show he meant business in a way that Masaaki Shirakawa, who led the bank before him, was widely judged not to have. But observers had tired of it by the end of Kuroda&rsquo;s long decade in charge. Now, Ueda faces the same credibility deficit.\\n\\nWhile misunderstanding around the BOJ&rsquo;s policy partly reflects ignorance of how the bank works and the differing ways in which Japan&rsquo;s economy operates, Ueda has deepened distrust of whether the bank says what it means and means what it says. A recent comment illuminates this lack of clarity. &ldquo;There is no specific level in my mind at this stage,&rdquo; Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida&nbsp;said&nbsp;last week, in response to a question&nbsp;about when the BOJ would step into&nbsp;the market for 10-year bonds. But then he offered a telling comment: &ldquo;I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it even if there was one.&rdquo;\\n\\nThe BOJ is likely sincere when it says the 2 percent price goal is still some way off, even if one member seemingly believes it&rsquo;s on the horizon. But the head fakes&nbsp;are making it difficult to know what it truly believes.\\n\\nThe need for circumspection, to put it charitably, may just be inherent in the whole YCC project. Krishna Guha, who covers global policy at Evercore ISI,&nbsp;has likened the approach to a shift in exchange-rate regimes. You never talk about it in advance for fear that speculators get too far ahead and, consequently, ruin the necessary element of surprise. There's something to that analogy. During the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis, the&nbsp;modus operandi of governments when faced with questions of devaluation was to deny or obfuscate. Same with Latin America in the following years.\\n\\nThere&rsquo;s&nbsp;a further comparison:&nbsp;capital controls. In the leadup to Malaysia's decision in September 1998 to slap restrictions on the flow of money out of the country, ministers would discourage discussion of the shift. Shirai is among those who argue that YCC itself was a fudge in the first place to make up for the deep unpopularity of negative rates, which she voted against in early 2016. The BOJ is still working to extricate itself from that decision.\\n\\nJapan isn't about to have a currency or debt crisis; the BOJ itself owns a swathe of the domestic bond market after decades of on-again-off-again quantitative easing. But a communications crisis is something else. It would be a tragedy if the&nbsp;mistrust&nbsp;and skepticism that pervaded the&nbsp;end of&nbsp;his predecessor's&nbsp;second term come to define Ueda's tenure just a few months after taking the oath of office.\\n\\nSuch are the thrills and spills of unconventional monetary policy.

As we increase the digitisation of our economy, we certainly want to make sure that the elements of hardware that are going into the digital economy are all monitored and come from trusted sources,&rdquo; the minister said. &ldquo;In hindsight, this should not have been called curbs or licensing. This should have been called more of an import management system.&rdquo;\\n\\nThe Centre last week mandated a licensing requirement for information technology (IT) hardware in what is being seen as a bid to cut imports from China and give a fillip to the government's recently announced Rs 17,000- crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for such devices.\\n\\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\\n\\nA day after it announced the curbs, the government on August 4 deferred the implementation of the decision to November 1 amid concerns that limited supplies could lead to a sudden spike in the prices of computing hardware.\\n\\n&ldquo;In the three months that we have given to the industry, we are sitting down and working out a framework for how the government's goals can be met, without disrupting what is the current growth and ambition of these companies,&rdquo; Chandrasekhar said.\\n\\n&ldquo;We want to work with industry as we have worked. We have done that in the smartphone category where there are global brands today that are using India as a very successful base.&rdquo;\\n\\nAccording to industry estimates, 1.5 million of the 2 million laptops sold on a quarterly basis in the country are imported.\\n\\nExemption from the curbs will be provided to players only for up to 20 of such items per consignment for the purpose of research and development, testing, benchmarking and evaluation, repair and re-export and for product development.\\n\\nPC and laptop makers such as Dell, HP, Lenovo and Asus are among those who will be impacted by these restrictions, say sector analysts, adding that many of these companies do have some sort of local manufacturing capabilities in India.\\n\\nApple, which imports its MacBooks to India, will also be affected.

The policy posed very few surprises, with a unanimous vote to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent. The stance was retained at remaining focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth, with a vote of 5:1. While the sanguine growth forecast was expectedly left unchanged, the inflation forecast was pushed up to 5.4 percent, higher than our expectation (+5.3 percent). Further, the temporary imposition of&nbsp;incremental cash reserve ratio&nbsp;(I-CRR) came as a surprise.\\nAs anticipated,&nbsp;the tone of the document was more hawkish than the June 2023 policy statement, given the rising uncertainties being posed by both food and crude oil prices, and a particularly erratic monsoon distribution, even though its eventual volume may well be in the normal range.&nbsp;The&nbsp;MPC highlighted&nbsp;that it will remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the target as well as anchoring inflation expectations. In line with the last two policies, the Governor once again stressed that bringing the CPI inflation within the tolerance band of 2-6 percent is not enough and the focus remains on aligning inflation to the target of 4.0 percent. In addition, he enunciated the concern that the frequent incidences of recurring food price shocks pose a risk to anchoring inflation expectations, adding to the hawkishness of this policy statement.\\nWarning On Inflation\\nThe MPC also warned that the&nbsp;headline inflation is likely to spike&nbsp;in the immediate term given supply disruptions emanating from adverse weather conditions. No sooner than the market internalised that just falling below 6 percent was not adequate, the CPI inflation is set to cross this threshold resoundingly in the soon-to-be-released print for July 2023. We suspect that after the short-lived respite, the July and August CPI inflation prints will be in an uncomfortable range of 6.5-7.0 percent.\\nNo surprises then, that the MPC increased its baseline forecast for inflation for Q2 FY2024 by a huge one percentage point to 6.2 percent from 5.2 percent. Subsequently, it sees inflation moderating to 5.7 percent in Q3 FY2024, and then to 5.2 percent each in Q4 FY2024 as well as Q1 FY2025. Based on the latter, we no longer expect rate cuts to commence in June 2024, and have pushed our forecast for the earliest cut to Q2 FY2025. Moreover, we continue to anticipate the rate cut cycle to be fairly shallow, limited to 50-75 bps.\\nAt the same time, the MPC emphasised the need to be vigilant and to be ready to act appropriately to ensure that the effects of shocks do not persist. While it reassured that it looks through idiosyncratic shocks, it warned that if such idiosyncrasies show signs of persistence, then it would have to act. This does leave the door open for an intermittent rate hike, although the bar for that would be quite high. In our view, inflation would need to persist above 6.0 percent for at least two quarters, amid transmission of pressures to core inflation, to set the stage for a rate hike.\\nOptimistic On Growth\\nNotwithstanding external challenges and monsoon-related risks, the MPC remained fairly upbeat on the prospects for domestic consumption and investment. We are particularly enthused by the capacity utilisation figure of 76.3 percent for Q4 FY2023, and are cautiously optimistic about a sustainable and broad-based, albeit realistic, capacity expansion cycle setting in. Moreover, both Central and state government capex has moved well above pre-Covid levels in the last two years. While implementation will remain crucial, we do expect the government to continue to prioritise allocations for capex over the medium term, which would support the growth prospects. &nbsp;\\nAs per our estimates, the&nbsp;measure on I-CRR&nbsp;will impound liquidity of the banking system of around Rs 900-950 billion. As a result, we expect the short-term rates on money market instruments like call money rates, treasury bills and commercial paper to jump by 15-20 bps in the near term. After the policy announcement, the yield of the current benchmark 10-year government security did waver, albeit in a narrow range. A new benchmark security is set to be unveiled on Friday. Amidst limited fiscal concerns and a high likelihood of an extended pause from the MPC, we foresee its yield in a range of 7.1-7.2 percent over the next two months. As a result of the measure to drain the liquidity overhang, the yield curve will likely flatten further in the immediate term.\\nAditi Nayar is Chief Economist and Head- Research &amp;amp;amp; Outreach, ICRA.&nbsp;Views are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.\\n'], ['moneycontrol', ' RBI policy less hawkish, interest rates to remain high for next few months: Unmesh Kulkarni of Julius Baer...', \"The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) rate decision in its monetary policy statement was pretty much on expected lines - status quo, as far as policy rates are concerned. Since the February policy, we have been expecting the RBI to be in an extended pause mode, and the current policy decision is in sync with our expectations.\\n\\nThe recent spike in food&nbsp;and vegetable prices has been a matter of concern for the near term, as it temporarily disrupts the downward trajectory of the consumer price inflation (CPI) that the RBI has been successfully able to achieve through its monetary policy actions and liquidity management. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has raised its inflation forecast significantly (by 100 bps) for Q2FY24 to 6.2 percent, which is beyond the 6 percent upper limit of RBI&rsquo;s tolerance band.\\n\\nThe MPC has also upped its CPI projections by 30 bps for Q3, and by an overall 30 bps for full FY2023-24. However, as we were expecting, the MPC has decided to look through the current spike in food inflation (caused by non-seasonal rains, El Nino, etc.), as it views this spike as temporary.\\n\\nWhat is notable, however, is that the RBI has projected CPI for Q1FY25 (i.e., April-June of the next financial year) at an elevated 5.2 percent. Given the continuous reinforcement by the governor of the 4.0 percent median CPI target, the latest forecasts basically throw out of the window any rate cut expectations in FY24. Unless there is a significant deterioration in global growth that has spillover effect on domestic growth, it looks pretty unlikely that the RBI will change course during the current financial year.\\n\\nAlso read:&nbsp;In fight against inflation, MPC caught between a rock and a hard place\\n\\nA bit of a surprise element in this policy statement was the introduction of the 10 percent incremental cash reserve ratio (referred to as I-CRR) on the net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of banks during the recent May-July period. The governor has acknowledged that the RBI&rsquo;s Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) auctions are not having the full desired impact on withdrawal of liquidity, which remains in surplus mode, as banks are preferring to park their excess liquidity in the SDF window instead of the VRRR window. The I-CRR measure is intended to be temporary (possible until 8 September) and non-disruptive; however, it is likely to move up the money market rates in the near term.\\n\\nOverall, the RBI&rsquo;s policy tone continues to focus on maintaining a harmonious balance between containment of inflation on the one hand and supporting growth on the other hand, while keeping liquidity tight. Yield curves will continue to be flat in the near term due to the central bank&rsquo;s focus on tightening liquidity.\\n\\nAlso read:&nbsp;Should avoid knee-jerk reactions to inflation data, says Das\\n\\nThe policy, while appearing to be less hawkish compared to the previous one, pushes further back any expectations around rate cuts or even diluting the policy stance (from the long-standing 'withdrawal of accommodation'). Domestic interest rates will continue to remain high over the next few months, until there is visibility around resumption of the downward trajectory of the headline CPI, or growth conditions moderating meaningfully.\\n\\nIn the current scenario, investors can take advantage of the high interest rate regime and invest in short-medium term fixed income opportunities, while allocation to longer duration investments can preferably be staggered with a longer investment horizon in mind.\\n\\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Yet the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), to its eternal shame, said, &ldquo;Going forward, the spike in vegetable prices, led by tomatoes, would exert sizeable upside pressures on the near-term headline inflation trajectory.&rdquo; Clearly, they lack the knowledge that tomato is a fruit, indeed one that was supposed to have aphrodisiac powers, as evidenced by the French calling it pomme d&rsquo;amour, or love apple.&nbsp;\\nThe upside is that, by the same logic, the MPC members are unlikely to put tomatoes in a fruit salad, thus making up in wisdom what they lack in knowledge. That wisdom is seen in their determination to &lsquo;look through&rsquo; the rise in food prices to the low inflation beyond and keep the policy rate unchanged, despite raising the retail inflation forecast for the current fiscal year to 5.4 percent, up from 5.1 percent projected at the last MPC meeting in June. Putting it another way, despite the widespread belief that tomato prices are a hot potato, the MPC thinks it is small potatoes.&nbsp;\\nThat doesn&rsquo;t mean, though, that the RBI governor is as cool as a cucumber and he doesn&rsquo;t give a fig about tomatoes. He said, &lsquo;The frequent incidences of recurring food price shocks, however, pose a risk to anchoring of inflation expectations&rsquo;. He added, &lsquo;We have to stand in readiness to go beyond keeping Arjuna&rsquo;s eye to deploying policy instruments, if necessary.&rsquo; As&nbsp;my colleague Aparna Iyer&nbsp;points out, these instruments could include an increase in the incremental cash reserve ratio, which will affect liquidity.&nbsp;\\nWhile the inflation outlook is a bit of a lemon, the MPC is full of beans about growth. The growth forecast for FY24 has been retained at 6.5 percent. What&rsquo;s more, the RBI governor also said, &lsquo;The total flow of resources to the commercial sector from banks and other sources taken together has increased by ₹7.5 lakh crore during the financial year 2023-24 so far (up to July 28) as compared with ₹5.7 lakh crore a year ago.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s an increase of 31.6 percent from a year ago, testimony to the strong growth momentum in the economy, in spite of the rate hikes by the central bank.&nbsp;\\nWith that kind of growth momentum and with abundant liquidity, could there be a risk of inflation spilling over to the broad economy? The RBI took a small step in draining some of the liquidity, by a temporary increase in the incremental cash reserve requirement ratio to 10 percent. It&rsquo;s such an&nbsp;itsy-bitsy teen-weeny step that it reminded me of these lines from the famous song: &nbsp;\\nShe was afraid to come out of the locker\\nShe was as nervous as she could be.\\nBe that as it may, the RBI has reiterated that it is &lsquo;firmly focused on aligning inflation to the target of 4.0 per cent&rsquo;, which means that chances of any rate cuts this fiscal year are dim--the policy rate will remain high for longer.&nbsp;\\nDoes that mean growth will slow? Well, interest cover for the listed non-financial sector and for listed manufacturing companies is much higher now than it was in the years before the pandemic. Rising interest rates don&rsquo;t seem to have held back growth or affected profits. And the government is certain to do all it can to reduce food inflation in the run up to the general election next year. &nbsp;\\nRBI governor Das also said investment activity has gained steam on the back of government capital expenditure, rising business optimism and revival in private capex in certain key sectors. Construction activity remains strong. Further, Das clearly said, &lsquo;Aggregate demand conditions continue to be buoyant.&rsquo;&nbsp;\\nAll that should support the markets, despite the temporary scare from tomatoes. For the Indian economy, it&rsquo;s still peaches and cream.&nbsp;\\nInvesting insights from our research team\\n\\nWhat could be the implications of RBI&rsquo;s monetary policy on banks?\\n\\nRateGain continues to cruise fast\\n\\nZee Entertainment: Weak performance, ad spend recovery delayed\\n\\nBharat Forge Q1: Strong set of numbers, valuation demanding\\n\\nHome First Finance Q1 FY24: Profit surge on higher loan and asset growth\\n\\nWhat does Aarti&rsquo;s result hold for the chemical sector?\\n\\nTVS Supply Chain Solutions IPO: Global factors dampen the growth narrative\\n\\nEmami: Margins to improve, growth likely to come back\\n\\nIdeaForge Technology: Pricing in too much optimism\\n\\n\\nWhat else are we reading?\\n\\nA downgrade, resilient jobs, incoming higher inflation: How should market read them all?\\n\\nA new Licence Raj is not the best way to promote domestic manufacturing\\n\\nIs Q1 as good as it gets for India&rsquo;s banks?\\n\\nSoft summer season hits healthcare service providers\\n\\nChart of the Day: What do India Inc&rsquo;s rising cash flows signal?\\n\\nLEX: Lyft &mdash; Fare cuts bring little cheer for Uber peer&nbsp;(republished from the FT)\\n\\nIndia's PC import restrictions provide neither carrot nor stick\\n\\nDoes money win the war &mdash; Inferences from the Russian push in defence expenditure\\n\\nDelay in Go First&rsquo;s revival plan calls for a change in strategy\\n\\nFitch was right: political dysfunction and reckless fiscal policy impair US debt\\n\\nThree factors that prevent India and China from getting close\\n\\nCan Tesla&rsquo;s magic survive without its wizard?\\n\\nN Vittal: Bureaucrat who made the software horse fly\\n\\nPersonal Finance\\n\\nWhat NRIs must keep in mind when investing their money\\nTechnical Picks:&nbsp;Ashok Leyland,&nbsp;Castor seed,&nbsp;GAIL,&nbsp;Steel Authority of India&nbsp;and&nbsp;Varun Beverages&nbsp;(These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app).\\nWe have a crack team of reporters writing on everything startups and tech.

The introduction of incremental cash reserve ratio to mop up excess liquidity created by the return of Rs 2,000 currency notes, which was not anticipated, could temporarily harden short-term rates. The RBI policy stance, however, did not come as a surprise to the markets.\\n\\nUnderstandably, the rate hikes in advanced countries have been more aggressive as they are facing a steeper inflation challenge compared with India. The US Federal Reserve, for instance, has raised rates by 525 basis points (bps) versus India&rsquo;s 250 bps in the current hiking cycle. While the Fed&rsquo;s latest hike may well be its last for the current cycle, the European Central Bank is expected to continue tightening policy because inflation in its remit has been stickier.\\n\\nOverall, interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer in the West given the headline inflation remains above redline and core inflation sticky. In contrast, the pressure on monetary policy in Asia has abated due to softening inflation.\\n\\nInflation Rebounds \\n\\nThe RBI&rsquo;s caution on inflation has stood it in good stead as inflation, which appeared to have peaked during the June policy announcement, has rebounded. Mint Road has been relentlessly communicating that the fight is far from over and the August policy review reiterates this stance.\\n\\nIn the face of strong economic growth in the first quarter, the RBI kept its forecast for India&rsquo;s GDP growth unchanged at 6.5 percent. But the recent spike in food inflation has created an upside to the RBI&rsquo;s July-September CPI forecast of 5.2 percent &mdash; a number it now sees rising to 6.2 percent. For the current fiscal, it expects the CPI inflation print to be 5.4 percent, or 30 bps higher than the June forecast.\\n\\nVarious indicators point to an overall strong growth momentum in the first quarter. Government investments have expanded at a fast pace and credit growth is quite healthy. The Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index was in the robust expansion zone and averaged 58 and 61 for manufacturing and services, respectively, during the four months ending July. Merchandise exports continued to contract for five months in a row, but that has not slowed down overall economic activity.\\n\\nInterestingly, high growth is not the main reason for rising pressure on inflation. Rather food inflation is the culprit. In contrast to the services part of core inflation, which remains under pressure due to strong demand for services, the goods retail inflation is seeing a continued drop. Goods inflation, with one-third weight in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), plummeted from 12 percent in June 2023 over the same month last year due to sharp correction in input costs. The non-food part of the Wholesale Price Index, which is a proxy for input costs, fell on year in June.\\n\\nCompanies have passed on some part of the cost reduction to the end consumer and used the other to cushion profit margins. This trend is likely to continue through the year as suggested by the Business Inflation Expectation Survey from IIM Ahmedabad &mdash; average year-ahead inflation expectations of the firms remained within 4 percent for two consecutive months.\\n\\nAdditionally, fuel inflation is in low single digits due to the high base effect as crude prices continue to trail last year&rsquo;s levels. The continued rise in international crude prices does raise concerns on this front. The services component of core inflation, which has a 27 percent weight in CPI, did come down but has been sticky in the last few months.\\n\\nPressure From Food Prices\\n\\nFood inflation, with 40 percent weight, is the idiosyncratic part of inflation. Inflation in cereals, pulses and spices is in double digits and vegetable prices have risen sharply due to shock from weather and pests. Vegetable inflation, where spikes are normally transitory and correct in around two months, is not a lasting worry. But foodgrain inflation could prove to be tricky due to domestic and global factors.\\n\\nOur research shows that food inflation can be high even when the monsoon is normal. For instance, food inflation printed over 6 percent in three of the past four normal monsoon years. The risk to food inflation from excess rains is playing out in vegetables and delayed sowing. The possibility of a weak El Ni&ntilde;o, associated with dry conditions in the latter part of the monsoon season, was confirmed by Indian Meteorological Department recently.\\n\\nFrom a global perspective, El Ni&ntilde;o is also a risk to crops in other major global producing economies, such as palm oil in Indonesia and Malaysia and rice in Thailand and Vietnam. Among these, palm oil is a major import for India. Currently, edible oil prices are lower than last year, but a global shock can reverse this. For the record, India imports 60 percent of its edible oil requirement. The concern about food inflation is evident in the pre-emptive steps the government is taking, such as banning some types of rice exports, imposing stocking limits on wheat, and market intervention at reduced prices.\\n\\nIn this milieu, we expect rate cuts early next year if current food inflation pressure proves to be transitory and headline inflation stays on the projected trajectory. Although the RBI&rsquo;s rate hikes cannot directly impact supply-side-driven food inflation, it becomes a concern if it sustains, spills over to other components, and steers headline inflation away from its target. Mint Road will, therefore, keep its eyes peeled on food inflation.\\n\\nDharmakirti Joshi is Chief Economist, CRISIL.

But this can be avoided if you just know how to manage your MF folios.\\n\\nWhat is an MF folio?\\n\\nMutual fund folio can loosely be compared to an account in a bank. One can have multiple accounts in a bank. Similarly, one can have multiple folios with a mutual fund house. Mutual funds also allow zero-balance folio. Simply put, if you sell all units of schemes held in a particular folio then it becomes a zero-balance folio. Such folios can be used again to invest in schemes of mutual fund schemes. Each mutual fund house issues a separate folio number. For subsequent investments, you are supposed to quote the same folio number if you want to keep your investment under one folio. Otherwise, a different folio number is issued.\\nALSO READ: FD rates for Senior Citizens: Banks that offer up to 9.1% interest on 3-year deposits\\n\\nNowadays, while creating new mutual fund folios, the fund house asks for KYC (know-your-client) details, contact details and nominations before allowing investments. If you fail to provide these or do not choose explicitly not to appoint a nominee, then the fund folios cannot be created. Be it a paper route or an online route, while creating a new folio, these inputs are must.\\n\\nBut in earlier days it was not the case. Many times investors initiated investments without keying in the right inputs. For example, some investors used to ask distributors to write the distributors&rsquo; mobile numbers and email ids as the contact information. Over a period of time, such lapses can adversely affect the ability to transact. For example, the one-time password (OTP) sent for login into the portal or approving transactions may not reach the investor at all if the phone or email does not belong to the investor.\\n\\nALSO READ: Why a separate healthcare fund is a must for those living with Parkinson&rsquo;s, Alzheimer&rsquo;s diseases\\n\\nFixing the lapses\\n\\nThe capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has, over time, been tightening the operational aspects when it comes to investing in MFs. The mutual fund investors were asked to declare if the email and mobile numbers keyed into their folios belonged to them or their family members. If you have old folios without such details, then you need to fix them as soon as possible. Over time, fund houses and registrar and transfer agents (RTAs) got in touch with investors to set records straight in their MF investments.\\n\\nAs investors, you should make sure that the information and nominations in your folios are up to date. If your MF folio does not have a nomination or you do not explicitly opt out of it before September 30, 2023, then you will not be allowed to redeem, switch or register a systematic transfer plan or systematic withdrawal plan from such folios from October 1, 2023.\\n\\nManaging folios\\n\\nSome Do-It-Yourself investors prefer to create separate folios for each financial goal. For example, one may use a folio to fund a child&rsquo;s education and another for funding retirement. Sometimes from the point of view of operational ease, separate folios are warranted. One can have a single-holder folio and a joint-holder folio as well. Within a joint-holder folio, a maximum of three investors are allowed including the first holder. Joint holder folios can be operated by either or a survivor mandate or with a joint mandate. There is no restriction on how many folios you can have. However, to make it easy for you to track, keep the number of folios to a bare minimum, especially within fund houses.\\n\\nRupesh Bhansali, head-mutual fund, GEPL Capital, says, &ldquo;Consolidated account statement helps the investor with a list of all mutual funds investments. You can also sell trivial holdings in your MF portfolio and invest the proceeds in schemes that have meaningful weights in your portfolio.&rdquo;\\n\\nWhile consolidating the folios the holding patterns need to match. For example, only those folios can be consolidated where the unitholder is a single holder. If the folio is in the joint names, then it can be consolidated only with those folios held in the joint names in the same order. A folio held in the joint name, let&rsquo;s say A and B, cannot be consolidated with a folio held in the name of A or held in the name of B or a folio held in the name of B and A.\\n\\nALSO READ: Recurring deposits (RDs) offer an alternative to equity SIPs for risk-averse investors\\n\\nViral Bhatt, Founder, Money Mantra, a Mumbai-based financial planning firm, says, &ldquo;Mutual fund folios at AMC level can be consolidated by writing to the fund house or registrar and transfer agent (RTA). Single folio at the AMC level helps you to track your investment better and the AMC or RTA to service you better. Since you get a single view of your investments, you can make better investment decisions.&rdquo;\\n\\nDemat accounts\\n\\nDemat accounts act as folios when the units are held in demat accounts. Many online platforms hold units in demat accounts to curb the hassle arising out of multiple folios. Those online platforms that do not use demat accounts to hold units of mutual funds show existing folio details to the investor when she opts to invest in a scheme of a mutual fund where she is already holding an investment. However, if your distributor is not offering you such a facility or you have some legacy investments or you are transacting on multiple platforms, then you should check the folios and update your contact details and nominees wherever applicable, at the earliest opportunity.'], ['moneycontrol', 'Individual investors repose faith in MFs despite tough markets in FY23: SEBI report', 'The share of individual investors, which include both retail and high net worth individuals (HNI), rose to 55 percent in the total assets of the mutual fund industry during financial year 2022-23, driven by continuous growth of systematic investment plan (SIP) accounts.\\n\\nThese individual investors&rsquo; exposure in terms of percentage to total net assets of mutual funds stood at 52.7 percent during FY22, showed data provided in the Securities and Exchange Board of India&rsquo;s (SEBI) latest annual report.\\n\\nThe rise in the unitholding pattern of mutual funds by individual investors came at the time when markets remained largely flat during the year.\\n\\nFollowing two years of exceptional performance, Indian equity markets took a breather in 2022-23, with benchmark indices Nifty 50 and Sensex delivering negative of -0.48 percent and -1.76 percent, respectively, during the period.\\n\\nThe SEBI annual report also showed that the exposure of corporate and institutional investors in mutual funds fell to 40.8 percent during FY23 from 43.5 percent in the preceding period.\\n\\nRetail push\\n\\nDespite market gyrations, retail investors have largely remained bullish on stock markets and have been disciplined in their approach.\\n\\nAlso read |&nbsp;342 MF schemes record negative returns in FY23, 6x increase YoY: SEBI report\\n\\nInvestments via systematic investment plans (SIPs) stood at Rs 14,734 crore in June 2023.

On August 7, TVS Supply Chain Solutions announced that its IPO will be open for bidding from August 10 to August 14. The last TVS Group company to be listed was TVS Electronics in 1994.\\n\\nTVS Supply Chain Solutions began operations as a part of the group under the name TVS Logistics before becoming a separate company in 2004.\\n\\nToday, TVS Supply Chain Solutions, or TVS SCS, as a global supply chain company, provides end-to-end solutions to Fortune 500 companies across the world. The business is divided into two main components: Integrated Supply Chain Solutions and Network Solutions.\\n\\nALSO READ: TVS Supply Chain Solutions IPO records 36% booking on debut\\n\\nUnder Integrated Supply Chain Solutions, the company provides technology-based solutions for sourcing and procurement, integrated transportation, product management solutions, logistics operation centres and in-plant logistics such as finished goods and after-market fulfilment among others.\\n\\nUnder Network Solutions, it provides two types of services: Global Freight Solutions and Time Critical Final Mile Solutions, which include a variety of services such as spare parts logistics services, return, refurbishment and engineering support and courier services to B2B businesses, both large and small.\\n\\nTranslated, what this means is that, a manufacturing company, after having recognised its suppliers and customers, need not bother about how to get things &ldquo;moving.&rdquo; It can outsource the entire operations to TVS Supply Chain, which will pick up the raw material from anywhere in the world and get it to delivered to the company&rsquo;s factories, and pick up finished good and deliver to its customers, be it in India or abroad. All the works along the way, be it warehousing or booking containers for transport, or taking care of custom clearances, the company will take care of everything.\\n\\nNow, we know India is likely to grow exports big-time, thanks to government&rsquo;s thrust and global companies&rsquo; push to diversify their sourcing base beyond China, widely termed as a China-plus-one strategy. This obviously means more business for a company like TVS Supply Chain.\\n\\nOn solid ground\\n\\nAnalysts believe the company has the competitive strength to provide end-to-end supply-chain solutions. So far, the company has grown largely through acquisitions, about 16 acquisitions over the past 17&nbsp; years.&nbsp; Thus, it has both the domain expertise, and the global presence, which means it can replicate the know-how to future customers operating in a variety of geographies and industries.\\n\\nCurrently, TVS SCS has clientele in 26 countries across Europe, Asia (including India) and Australia.\\n\\nAccording to a report by HDFC Securities, with the use of integrated, data-driven, end-to-end solutions, the company has been able deliver value to customer and gain their trust. This has mean high rate of repeat customers, which ensures a steady flow of business from existing customers, even as the company focusses on new customer additions.\\n\\n&ldquo;Our unit of measure is a project or a contract; how many contracts do we have, what is the longevity of these contracts, and what is our renewal ability&hellip;We have a renewal rate of around 99 percent, and it is our ability to win new contracts, which is the focus,&rdquo; Ravi Viswanathan, Managing Director, TVS SCS, told Moneycontrol during a recent interaction. Recently, it added UK-based Centrica plc to its roster for &ldquo;supply chain transformation&rdquo;. Like most of its deals, TVS signed the Centrica deal for 7 years plus.\\n\\nDiversified portfolio\\n\\nWhile the business opportunity for TVS is huge, and it has a replicable model in place, by the very nature of its business, it won&rsquo;t be immune to any headwinds in global trade, say analysts. This is what the Covid period showed. During Covid, the company&rsquo;s revenue hardly grew and the business made losses. Only in FY23, it could get back in the green with a profit of Rs 10,311.01 crore.\\n\\nWhat saves the day for the company in bad times though is the fact that it has a diversified portfolio. Any slump in one particular industry or country may be off-set by growth in the others. &ldquo;The global supply chains were impacted and so were many of our customers like electronic components and auto manufacturers. Thankfully, our portfolio is fairly diverse. So we were able to manage the business effectively,&rdquo; it said. Currently, about 50 percent of TVS SCS business comes from manufacturing; 30 percent comes from non-auto and 20 percent comes from auto. Non-auto businesses include electronics, mining, alternate power, technology and consumer goods while within auto it supports both production and the after-markets. &ldquo;In many ways, our business model is a de-risked one. In spite of very strong economic headwinds in the western markets because of the war and inflation, last fiscal our business grew,&rdquo; the management recently told Moneycontrol.\\n\\nCapital intensity\\n\\nThe past three fiscal years for which its financials are available, the company clocked losses in two years. Last fiscal, it recorded a net profit of Rs 41.7 crore as against a loss of Rs 73.9 crore in FY21. EBIDTA margin for FY23 stood at 6.68 percent. Return ratios were also unimpressive with ROE at 5.50&nbsp;percent and ROCE at 7.64 percent.\\n\\n .\\n\\nThe financial numbers at this point do not point to a very profitable business, although the management boasts of an &lsquo;asset-light&rsquo; model and says that it is striving for a double digit EBIDTA by in the next few years. Being asset-light means that the company does not own any its fleet, containers or warehouse space, all of which is great because it means the capital requirement for the business is not too much. It leases warehouses and vehicles and has complete control over control over the capacity and fleet. The scheduling, routing, storing, and delivery of goods are managed by the company, which enables it to maintain control over operational quality metrics while keep things flexible to suit customer requirements.\\n\\nYet, the asset-light model is largely seen as a good model, a HDFC Securities report says that the company&rsquo;s high dependency on third parties and network partners for warehousing and transformation, could impact operations, financials and cash flows. Besides, the company&rsquo;s freight, clearing, forwarding and handling charges, and manpower expenses (comprising employee benefit expenses, sub-contracting costs and casual labour charges) constitute a significant portion of its operating expenses, which means any increase due to any internal or external factors may also adversely affect kits financials. While these are usually passed on to the clients, it may not always be possible, and depends on what the contracts provide for. Another challenge HDFC Securities points out is its exposure to foreign currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency could impact both its revenue and borrowings.\\n\\nIndia opportunities\\n\\nWhile a lot of its presence is international, the growing supply chain market in India and the absence of a large-scale player of its size could be of advantage for TVS SCS in the domestic market, and most analysts believe that&rsquo;s what makes the company stand out is its diverse set of services with no like-to-like peer in the market. Currently, a large portion of the third-party logistics market in India is highly disorganised.\\n\\n\\n\\nNirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom, said, &ldquo;TVS SCS has the edge of large institutional clients, scale and expanse and the ability to provide end-to-end solutions which no other company does. This definitely has its advantages, including ease in creating synergies across different points in the supply chain process.&rdquo;\\n\\nIndeed, the logistics industry in India is expected to grow to $385 billion by FY2027 at a CAGR of 13 percent from FY2022 driven by favourable macroeconomic factors, growth of outsourcing in the Indian logistics sector, and government policies encouraging manufacturing and consumption such as the PLI scheme. Over the last couple of years, on the back of the China Plus One strategy by global companies, the government has been encouraging domestic manufacturing. Analysts believe this could be an additional advantage for the segment.\\n\\nIPO in focus\\n\\nTVS SCS had initially announced its intention for an IPO last year but it was reported that this was postponed keeping market conditions and investor sentiments in mind. Through the IPO, the company, which is being valued at Rs 9,200 crore, plans to raise around Rs 600 crore from fresh issue as against Rs 2,000 crore decided earlier. The funds raised, according to the company, will play an important role in helping it overcome past challenges associated with debt. Similarly, it has cut its offer-for-sale to 14.23 million shares from 59 million shares planned earlier. The fixed price band for its initial public offering is Rs 187-197. At the higher end of the issue price, the company is valued at a market-cap of Rs 8,750 crore. The issue is priced at 10.5 times based on its net asset value of Rs 18.89 as of Mar 2023.\\n\\nConsidering the company&rsquo;s pedigree with the TVS group, which is seen as a shareholder-friendly group, and the tremendous growth opportunity, the stock seems to have the potential to ride the growth wave and create wealth over the long haul. But in the short to medium term, this may not be a great bet. Karkera says he sees good potential for the stock, amongst larger institutional investors. &ldquo;The sector warrants a lot of institutional interest and these investors are willing to take a longer-term risk on the sector which is in an expansion mode,&rdquo; he said.'], ['moneycontrol', 'SBFC Finance to finalise basis of allotment of IPO shares today', \"SBFC Finance, the MSME-focused non-banking finance company, is going to finalise the basis of allotment for its IPO shares by the end of August 10.

Metal coins never stayed in the 13 colonies long, flowing in a ceaseless stream to England and elsewhere, as payment for imported goods. Several colonies began printing bits of paper to stand in for coins, stating that within a certain time period, they could be used locally as currency. The system worked, but haltingly, the colonies soon discovered. Print too many bills, and the money became worthless. And counterfeiters often found the bills easy to copy, devaluing the real stuff with a flood of fakes.\\n\\nFranklin, who started his career as a printer, was an inveterate inventor who would also create the lightning rod and bifocals, found paper money fascinating. In 1731, he won the contract to print 40,000 pounds for the colony of Pennsylvania, and he applied his penchant for innovation to currency.\\n\\nDuring his printing career, Franklin produced a stream of baroque, often beautiful money. He created a copper plate of a sage leaf to print on money to foil counterfeiters: The intricate pattern of veins could not easily be imitated. He influenced a number of other printers and experimented with producing new paper and concocting inks.\\n\\nNow, in a study published earlier this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of physicists has revealed new details about the composition of the ink and paper that Franklin used, raising questions about which of his innovations were intended as defenses against counterfeiting and which were simply experiments with new printing techniques.\\n\\nThe study draws on more than 600 artifacts held by the University of Notre Dame, said Khachatur Manukyan, a physicist at that institution and an author of the new paper. He and his colleagues looked at 18th century American currency using Raman spectroscopy, which uses a laser beam to identify specific substances &mdash; such as silicon or lead &mdash; based on their vibration. They also used a variety of microscopy techniques to examine the paper on which the money was printed.\\n\\nSome of what they observed confirms what historians have long known: Franklin&rsquo;s paper money contains flecks of mica, also known as muscovite or isinglass. These shiny patches were most likely an attempt to combat counterfeiters, who would not have had access to this special paper, said Jessica Linker, a professor of American history at Northeastern University who studies paper money of this era and was not involved in the study. Of course, that didn&rsquo;t stop them from trying.\\n\\n&ldquo;They come up with very good counterfeits, with mica pasted to the surface,&rdquo; Linker said.\\n\\nIn the new study, the researchers found that the mica in bills for different colonies seems to have come from the same geological source, suggesting that a single mill produced the paper. The Philadelphia area is notable for its schist, a flaky mineral that contains mica; it&rsquo;s possible that Franklin or printers and papermakers associated with him collected the substance used in their paper locally, Manukyan said.\\n\\nWhen they examined the black ink on some of the bills, however, the scientists were surprised to find that it appeared to contain graphite. For most printing jobs, Franklin tended to use black ink made from burned vegetable oils, known as lampblack, said James Green, librarian emeritus of the Library Company of Philadelphia. Graphite would have been hard to find, he suspects.\\n\\n&ldquo;So Franklin&rsquo;s use of graphite in money printing is very surprising, and his use on bills printed as early as 1734 is even more surprising,&rdquo; Green said in an email.\\n\\nCould using graphite ink have been a way to differentiate real money from fakes? Differences in color between graphite and lampblack are likely to have been subtle enough to make that a difficult task, Green said. Instead, we may be looking at another example of Franklin&rsquo;s creativity.\\n\\n&ldquo;It suggests to me that almost from the start, he was using his money printing contracts as an opportunity to experiment with an array of new printing techniques,&rdquo; he said.\\n\\nTo understand more clearly Franklin&rsquo;s intent, more analyses of printed documents from the era would be helpful, said Joseph Adelman, a professor of history at Framingham State University in Massachusetts.\\n\\n&ldquo;The comparison I would most like to see would be Franklin&rsquo;s other publications,&rdquo; Adelman said. &ldquo;To really test this theory &mdash; does Franklin have this separate store of ink?&rdquo;\\n\\nIn future research, Manukyan hopes to collaborate with scholars who have access to larger collections of early American paper money. These techniques can be quite valuable in the study of history, Linker said, if scientists and historians can work together to identify the best questions to answer.\\n\\n&ldquo;I have questions about a whole bunch of inks. There&rsquo;s a really weird green on some of the New Jersey bills,&rdquo; she said, referring to money printed by a Franklin contemporary. &ldquo;I would love to know what that green ink was made of.&rdquo;\\n\\n(Author: Veronique Greenwood)/(c.2021 The New York Times Company)'], ['moneycontrol', 'Internationalising INR:&nbsp;Local currency swap deals with trade partners can provide a boost', \"No matter how well articulated the logic is, central bankers always have a tinge of conservativeness; the recently released Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) report of RBI on the internationalisation of the Indian rupee (INR) is no exception. The developments in the currency front cannot be studied in isolation, these are interlinked with the progress of the external sector and the composition of GDP growth. Over the last three decades not only our trade linkages with the world have increased, funds flow has gone up too. On the currency front, there are mixed signals, as a reserve currency the dominance of US dollars is on the wane. Yet, the dollar&rsquo;s share in foreign exchange turnover as indicated by Bank for International Settlement (BIS) Triennial Central Bank Survey was 88 percent in 2022. There are clear signs that in a multipolar world, other countries have a role to play too.\\nDealing With Financial Flows\\nInternationalisation of the INR&nbsp;at the initial stage has to focus on denominating and&nbsp;settling cross-border trade&nbsp;and financial transactions in rupees. At this stage, it is useful to note that trade presents one part of the story; to complete the story one has to take into consideration the burgeoning financial flows. Current account convertibility would allow us to handle the trade issues. However, these days many of the transactions are purely financial dealings, which are not connected to trade. As the complexity of financial flows increases, the issue of capital account convertibility would require more attention.\\nInternationalisation of currencies of emerging countries like that of India and China has three components, firstly, there has to be invoicing in domestic currency along with trade and settlement. Secondly, there is a need to focus on capital account convertibility and thirdly, one can explore the scope of entry to special drawing rights (SDR) basket. This can allow the currency to become a part of the reserve currency of other countries' central banks. The third objective is a long-term one.\\nBoost From Trade\\nThe increasing acceptability of a currency is also closely linked to the home country&rsquo;s progress in international trade. The growing demand for yuan internationally is closely linked to the growth of China&rsquo;s manufacturing exports. For India too, exports of goods and services can play an important role, particularly in the context of bilateral and multilateral trade arrangements in local currency.&nbsp;Acceptance of the INR as settlement currency by the Asian Clearing Union&nbsp;is indeed welcome. China&rsquo;s experience in this area is noteworthy, between 2009 and 2020 China opened swap lines with 41 countries. The total amount exceeded RMB 3.5 trillion which was equivalent to $554 billion. They have a similar swap line with Russia which is more than $600 billion. The primary purpose is to enhance investment and trade with bilateral partners and reduce their dependence on the dollar and increase the acceptance of the yuan. These countries include South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.\\nIn a similar manner, local currency swap arrangements would provide liquidity to our trading partners for the purchase of Indian goods and services. There is also a need to further liberalise Indian government securities, corporate and sovereign bond markets for countries like the United Arab Emirates and Russia. The&nbsp;sudden fillip for the rupee trade&nbsp;in 2022 and 2023 came from the Russian offer of discounted crude on account of sanctions. The trade deficit with Russia is now $36 billion. The question to ask is if these discounts disappear due to the withdrawal of discounted crude offers or some other reason, then what will happen to the rupee trade? In other words, the rupee trade cannot be an outlier. We need to have a clear strategy for enhancing rupee trade with a number of countries including our neighbours.\\nInterestingly, neither India nor China has capital account convertibility, considered a precondition for the internationalisation of a currency. It is even more amazing that the yuan has become a reserve currency though not a safe haven currency without capital account convertibility. Often, we tend to forget that many countries with open capital accounts play very limited roles in international finance. Some examples are Guyana, Jamaica, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago. Relatively poorer developing economies often have an open capital account for attracting capital. Incidentally, Indonesia too has an open capital account, it is a by-product of the capital shortage days. In other words, capital account convertibility is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the success of a country&rsquo;s currency internationalisation process.\\nFurther, many policymakers believe that floating currency goes hand-in-hand with an open capital account, this too is not a necessary condition. Hong Kong has an open capital account but its currency is pegged to the US dollar. When US interest rates started going up, capital outflows forced Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate to move up, this in its turn had the stock market in a squeeze. All these have some lessons for India &mdash; there is no tearing hurry for capital account convertibility. The establishment of domestic macroeconomic stability conditions should precede capital account convertibility.\\nSiddhartha Roy is&nbsp;the former Economic Advisor of the Tata Group.

The company has revised its revenue guidance twice in a span of three months due to weakened demand. The recent wave of high-level managerial resignations has further complicated the situation. In a soft-demand environment, Infosys might be losing market share, as indicated by its subdued growth guidance for 2023-24.

This growth was hindered by factors such as the adverse influence of tariff differentials, sluggish expansion in asset capitalisation, and a significant 46 percent YoY decline in revenue from the consultancy segment. Nonetheless, the consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) demonstrated enhancement due to improved efficiencies.

Similarly, Ultratech Cement received 33 buy calls, 9 holds, and 4 sells, versus the earlier 37 buy calls and 4 each of hold and sell calls.\\n\\nIn the June quarter, UPL Ltd encountered substantial setbacks in both its profits and revenue, mainly due to a nearly double-digit decrease in sales volume. The company responded to aggressive pricing from Chinese sellers by implementing significant price reductions in international markets, according to a Motilal Oswal report.

The company also experienced a 32&nbsp;percent on-year&nbsp;drop in consolidated EBITDA, reaching Rs 5,700 crore, but this still exceeded analysts' projections by 10 percent, compared to their estimate of Rs 5,200 crore.\\n\\nThe company's net profit took a hit, declining by 40 percent to Rs 2,500 crore, yet it managed to surpass analysts' estimates by 22 percent, which were at Rs 2,000 crore. This improvement was primarily driven by increased other income, although it was somewhat offset by higher interest costs and tax expenditure.\\n\\nThe company has reported that the Chakla mine is progressing according to its established timeline and is anticipated to commence operations by FY26. Notably, the company has also achieved success in acquiring the Meenakshi West mine, which has the potential to yield approximately 6-7 million tonnes of coal annually. Looking ahead to FY24, the projected capital expenditure (capex) for both India operations and Novelis is estimated to be Rs 4,500 crore.\\n\\nAnalysts hold the belief that Hindalco will sustain its positive momentum due to several factors. These factors include the confidence in Novelis achieving its medium-term EBITDA-per-tonne&nbsp;target of $525 by the fourth quarter of FY24, the steadfast performance of Hindalco's aluminum operations in India, strengthened coal security resulting from the acquisition of the Meenakshi and Chakla coal mines, as well as the growth-focused capital expenditure aimed at expanding capacity in the downstream business segment.\\n\\nAnalysts hold the perspective that Hindalco exhibits a robust outlook for long-term opportunities. Their confidence is anchored in the company's leadership position in both the beverages can and automotive markets. This optimism is fuelled by the company's strong performance, driven by factors such as sturdy domestic demand, increased demand from electric vehicles and consumer durables sectors, elevated investments in infrastructure and construction, as well as heightened public and private sector capital expenditures.\\n\\nAs a result, Motilal Oswal Securities has raised their estimates for FY25 EBITDA and net profit by 4 percent and 10 percent, respectively.\\n\\nAccording to Antique Stock Broking, enhanced performance in the copper segment, improved aluminum operations (driven by increased downstream volume from the new 34 KT Silvassa extrusion facility and an ongoing additional expansion of 350 KT through debottlenecking at the Utkal Alumina), reduced coal expenses, and progress in enhancing Novelis' operations are expected to contribute to an uplift in profitability.\"], ['moneycontrol', 'Agri Picks Report August 09, 2023: Geojit', \"Geojit's report on Agri Picks\\nIndia's 2023-24 (Jul-Jun) kharif acreage was steady at 91.5 mln ha as of Friday, according to data from department of agriculture and farmers welfare. Acreage of paddy, the key grain in kharif season, was up 3% on year at 28.3 mln ha. The paddy acreage has turned positive in the last couple of weeks as sowing picked up with the increase in rainfall across the country. Monsoon rains, important for sowing rice in non-irrigated areas, were 5% above long-period average as of Friday. Since Jun 1, the country has received 504.4 mm rainfall, 5% above the normal weighted average of 481.9 mm for the period.

But excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation matched the smallest monthly increase in nearly two years. The inflation figure the government reported Thursday showed that consumer prices increased 3.2% from a year earlier. That was up from a 3% annual rise in June, which was the lowest rate in more than two years.\\n\\nThe July inflation figure remained far below last year&rsquo;s peak of 9.1%, though still above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s 2% target. The Fed, economists and investors, though, pay particular attention to the core inflation figures for signs of where inflationary pressures might be headed. From June to July, core inflation remained a tame 0.2%. Thursday&rsquo;s price data will be among the key barometers the Fed will weigh in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates.\\n\\nIn its drive to tame inflation, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate 11 times since March 2022 to a 22-year high. A jump in energy prices has rekindled some of the inflation pressures underlying the economy. Gasoline prices have surged nearly 30 cents over the past month to a national average of $3.83 a gallon, according to AAA. Economists say that in the fight to conquer inflation, easy progress has likely already been achieved. Gasoline prices, for example, though liable to bounce around from month to month, have already plunged from a peak national average of more than $5 a gallon, which was reached in June of last year after Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nMuch of the inflationary surge that began in 2021 was caused by clogged supply chains: Ports, factories and freight yards were overwhelmed by the explosive economic rebound from the pandemic recession of 2020. The result was delays, parts shortages and higher prices. But supply-chain backlogs have eased in the past year, sharply reducing upward pressure on goods prices.\\n\\nPrices of long-lasting manufactured goods actually dipped in June. Now, the Fed faces a daunting problem: persistent inflationary pressures in service businesses &mdash; restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues and the like &mdash; where wages represent a substantial share of costs. Worker shortages have led many of these services companies to sharply raise pay. Last week, for example, the Labor Department reported that average hourly wages rose 4.4% in July from a year earlier, more than expected.\\n\\nTo cover their higher labor costs, companies have typically raised their prices, thereby fueling inflation. Another factor working against continued declines in year-over-year inflation rates is that prices soared in the first half of last year before slowing in the second half. So any price increase in July would have the effect of boosting the year-over-year inflation rate. Still, economists caution against reading too much into one month of numbers.\\n\\nMany of them expect inflation to continue trending lower. Used car prices, which had skyrocketed after the pandemic, have been edging down: They dropped 5.1% in July from a year earlier to $29,198, according to Edmunds.com. July of last year was near the peak of used-car price spikes, resulting from a scarcity of new vehicles caused by a global computer-chip shortage. Buyers who wanted new vehicles but couldn&rsquo;t find them entered the used market, sending used prices sharply higher.\\n\\nThis year, though, used vehicle prices began to drop once automakers managed to acquire more chips and could produce more new vehicles. Many shoppers who were forced to buy used are now back in the new-vehicle market. Used-vehicle prices are expected to decline, at least modestly, through the year. Despite chronic concerns about higher labor costs, one closely watched measure of wages and salaries &mdash; the Labor Department&rsquo;s employment cost index &mdash; grew more slowly from April through June.\\n\\nExcluding government jobs, employee pay rose 1%, less than the 1.2% increase in the first three months of 2023. Compared with a year earlier, wages and salaries grew 4.6%, down from a year-over-year increase of 5.1% in the first quarter. Rents, which had soared after the pandemic, are also cooling. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote this week that &amp;quot;year-over-year shelter inflation will continue to slow through late 2024 and may even turn negative by mid-2024.&amp;quot;\\n\\nFed officials will have plenty of data to absorb before deciding whether to continue raising rates.

The United Nations&rsquo; food price index rose in July, interrupting its monthslong downward trend because of a jump in vegetable oil prices, driven in part by worries over shortages of Ukrainian sunflower seeds.\\n\\nDroughts in India, Indonesia and other Asian food exporters have led to smaller harvests. Faced with consumers outraged over higher prices, governments have banned the export of critical foods, causing further disruptions. Since late June, the price of an Asian benchmark for rice has jumped 25%, according to the Thai Rice Exporters Association.\\n\\nOther factors are pressuring prices on supermarket shelves, including higher labor costs as workers try to keep pace with inflation. And food producers are finding that in an environment of rising prices, they can lift them even higher to pad their profits.\\n\\nCompared with early 2020, consumer food prices are up about 30% in Europe and 23% in the United States.\\n\\nThe disruptions have had a disproportionately negative impact on small farmers and people living in low-income countries, while leaving the world vulnerable to future upheaval. Last year, more than 700 million people faced hunger and 2.4 billion people lacked year-round access to sufficient and nutritious food, according to the United Nations.\\n\\n&ldquo;The accumulation of the last shocks in the last few years have put countries in a very, very bad situation,&rdquo; said Maximo Torero, the chief economist of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. &ldquo;If another shock comes today, I honestly don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re going to handle it.&rdquo;\\n\\nExtreme Weather\\n\\nThis year, severe weather has been the main disrupter of food prices, said Hiral Patel, the head of sustainable and thematic research at Barclays in London.\\n\\nHeat waves have broken records in China, wildfires have raged across southern Europe and North Africa, and July was the world&rsquo;s hottest month on record.\\n\\nIn Pakistan, where catastrophic floods in 2022 washed away much of the country&rsquo;s crops, the annual rate of food price inflation reached nearly 49% in May, according to the U.N. World Food Program.\\n\\nForecasters warn that the earth could be entering a multiyear period of exceptional warmth driven by greenhouses gas emissions and the return of El Ni&ntilde;o, a cyclical weather pattern.\\n\\n&ldquo;There are increased chances of simultaneous crop losses in different parts of the world,&rdquo; Patel said.\\n\\nThe forecast for Europe&rsquo;s crop yields, including soft wheat and spring barley, was revised lower recently by the European Commission because of &ldquo;distinctly drier-than-usual conditions&rdquo; in large parts of the continent.\\n\\nCurtailed food production in one region for one year usually does not matter much in a flexible and dynamic market, said Joseph Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. The issue arises when crops are knocked out for a few years running in multiple markets &mdash; for example, from droughts.\\n\\n&ldquo;Those could create a lot more volatility going forward &mdash; it&rsquo;s one of the uncertainties about climate change,&rdquo; Glauber said. Persistent droughts &ldquo;could lead to regional shortfalls and, with poor countries unable to afford higher prices, food security issues.&rdquo;\\n\\nWar in Ukraine\\n\\nLast month, when Russian President Vladimir Putin let the Black Sea grain deal expire and then his military attacked grain storage in Ukraine, the price of wheat rose, which in turn lifted prices of corn and soybeans. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, recently estimated that the end of the deal could lead grain prices to increase by 10-15 percent.\\n\\nWhile that&rsquo;s a significant jump, it&rsquo;s smaller than the sudden surge in prices in the first weeks of the war.\\n\\nThat&rsquo;s because Ukrainian farmers are growing significantly less today. Ukraine also has increased its ability to export grain via rail and river, but these alternative routes cost more, said Voznesenski at Rabobank. And these routes aren&rsquo;t immune from attacks or severe weather, including drought.\\n\\n&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell what Putin is going to do tomorrow,&rdquo; Voznesenski said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell when a government is going to put an export restriction in.&rdquo; An increase in food supply intervention by governments &ldquo;is going to create a lot more unpredictability,&rdquo; he added.\\n\\nTrade Protectionism\\n\\nVolatility in food prices has encouraged some governments to turn to restricting trade in order to keep precious stores of food closer to home.\\n\\nLast month, India, the world&rsquo;s largest rice supplier, issued an export ban on non-basmati white rice. India had imposed a 20% export duty on that rice last year, but exports continued to rise because of geopolitical issues and extreme climate conditions in other countries, the Indian government said. On Friday, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported that rice prices in July were up nearly 20% from a year earlier, pushing its rice price index to the highest in 12 years.\\n\\nIndia is not alone in taking such measures. Overall, the number of curbs or tax increases on food exports has jumped 62% since last year, according to the Global Trade Alert, a nonprofit based in Switzerland. Globally, 176 export curbs are in effect on food, feed or fertilizer.\\n\\nEconomists and trade experts have cautioned against these types of policies. Though they may shield local consumers from food inflation in the near term, they ultimately compound the types of global food shortages that governments are trying to mitigate.\\n\\nIn a recent food security summit hosted by the U.N. in Rome, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director general of the World Trade Organization, urged countries to reject protectionism and turn to more open trade as a way to address food shortages.\\n\\nFor many countries, the problem has been worsened by the weak value of their currencies in comparison with the U.S. dollar, which leaves them unable to buy as many dollar-denominated commodities as before.\\n\\nInvisible Costs\\n\\nAs food producers are dealing with more supply risks, related expenses are also rising. Much of the cost of food we eat at home comes from transportation and other expenses faced by food companies &mdash; not just from the commodity cost of growing the wheat or sugar. And some of those nonagricultural costs are rising, too.\\n\\nCompanies are being forced to fork out money for insurance policies to deal with harsh weather and invest in new suppliers to make their business more resilient.\\n\\nPersistent drought has lowered water levels on key shipping routes, including the Panama Canal and the Rhine River in Europe, requiring shippers to lighten their loads or find other routes.\\n\\nAnd then there is the cost of sustainability efforts as countries seek to meet net-zero-emissions targets. In all, risks that food prices stay high or swing more wildly have grown.\\n\\nThis story first appeared in New York Times.\\n\\nc.2023 The New York Times Company'], ['moneycontrol', 'Maui Wildfires: Destructive blaze engulfs historic town in Hawaii, claiming 36 lives', \" Fire devours historic Waiola Church and nearby Lahaina Hongwanji Mission in Lahaina, Hawaii.

      "Average long-term US mortgage rate climbs to 6.96% this week, matching highest level this year\n",
      "The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate rose this week to just under 7%, the latest setback for would-be homebuyers already facing affordability challenges due to a housing market limited by a shortage of homes for sale.  Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on the benchmark 30-year home loan rose to 6.96% from 6.90% last week. A year ago, the rate averaged 5.22%.  It's the third consecutive weekly increase for the average rate, which now matches its high for the year set on July 13. High rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, limiting how much they can afford in a market already unaffordable to many Americans.  \"There is no doubt continued high rates will prolong affordability challenges longer than expected, particularly with home prices on the rise again,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. \"However, upward pressure on rates is the product of a resilient economy with low unemployment and strong wage growth, which historically has kept purchase demand solid.\"  The average rate on a 30-year mortgage remains more than double what it was two years ago, when it was just 2.87%. Those ultra-low rates spurred a wave of home sales and refinancing. The sharply higher rates now are contributing to a dearth of available homes, as homeowners who locked in those lower borrowing costs two years ago are now reluctant to sell and jump into a higher rate on a new property.  The lack of housing supply is also a big reason home sales are down 23% through the first half of this year.  The latest increase in rates follows an uptick in the 10-year Treasury yield, which climbed to 4.19% last week, it's highest level since early November. The yield, which lenders use to price rates on mortgages and other loans, was at 4.02% in midday trading Thursday.  High inflation drove the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022, lifting the fed funds rate to the highest level in 22 years. Inflation has come down steadily since last summer, and many analysts believe the Fed has reached the end of its rate hikes.  Mortgage rates don't necessarily mirror the Fed's rate increases, but tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Investors' expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Fed does with interest rates can influence rates on home loans.  The average rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with those refinancing their homes, rose to 6.34% from 6.25% last week. A year ago, it averaged 4.59%, Freddie Mac said.\n",

      "RBI's I-CRR will not cause any liquidity shortage for banks, say bankers\n",
      "The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) announcement of the Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR) is unlikely to create any liquidity shortage for the banking industry, which in turn could hinder the lending process, bankers told Moneycontrol on August 10. Bankers are drawing comfort from the assurance of RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das during the post-policy press conference that the central bank will remain nimble towards liquidity management and act on both sides, they added.  \"There is the availability of liquidity for credit. For that, I don't think there's any impact because banks have sufficient liquidity available,\" said Ashwani Kumar, Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of UCO Bank.  Earlier today, the central bank said that scheduled commercial banks have to maintain an incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19, 2023, and July 28, 2023. This was announced with the aim of managing the higher surplus liquidity sloshing about in the economy following the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system.  On May 19, the RBI announced the withdrawal of the Rs 2,000 note, allowing citizens to either exchange the note or deposit it in their accounts. On August 1, the central bank said that Rs 3.14 lakh crore worth of Rs 2,000 banknotes, or 88 percent in circulation, had returned to the banking system by July 31.  However, some bankers said that if liquidity does not remain under control, then the RBI can extend the period.  \"We are looking at this as a temporary measure, and we hope it remains the same. If the liquidity system is not under control in the prescribed period that the central bank has said, we can expect the central bank to extend I-CRR imposition,\" said Shekhar Bhandari, President of Global Transaction Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank.  On the earnings front, Kumar added that there will be little impact, if any, on bank earnings.  At his address, Governor Das highlighted that the central bank considered the imposition of I-CRR desirable in the interest of financial and price stability and that banks would have enough liquidity to do their lending operations.  \"The Incremental CRR was considered necessary in the background of the liquidity overhang. We considered it desirable in the interest of financial and price stability. It will also have an impact on inflation. It is a purely temporary measure,\" Das said.  No impact on rates  Suresh Khatanhar,  Deputy Managing Director, IDBI Bank, said banks may not make any changes in their deposit or lending rates after the policy announcement.  On August 10, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) unanimously voted to leave the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent, Governor Das announced today.  The Standing Deposit Facility rate has also been retained at 6.25 percent. Also, both the Marginal Standing Facility rate and the Bank Rate have been retained at 6.75 percent.  \"We were expecting the repo rate to continue to pause, Ashwani Kumar added. From the perspective of the Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR), there is stability in interest rates. Some bands within one or two buckets may see some increase in interest rates, he said.  The RBI held interest rates unchanged for the third successive time in the current financial year.  On the RBI's decision to increase the transaction limit of UPI Lite to Rs 500 from Rs 200, bankers said the move will increase digitisation.  Launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in September 2022, UPI Lite allows quick small-value transactions by optimising the processing resources of banks, thereby reducing transaction failures.  It allows users to conduct transactions of up to Rs 200 a day without the need for a pin codewhich has reduced the transaction time. While the transaction limit has been raised to Rs 500 now, the UPI Lite balance ceiling has been left unchanged at Rs 2,000 to contain the risks associated with the relaxation of two-factor authentication.  UPI Lite is available on Paytm. The BHIM app, GooglePay, and other payment apps. Canara Bank, HDFC Bank, Indian Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, and Utkarsh Small Finance Bank are already live in UPI Lite.\n",

      "MC Explains | All you need to know about the Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio\n",
      "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on August 10 said that scheduled banks have to maintain an incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19 and July 28.  The central bank added that the existing cash reserve ratio (CRR) remains unchanged at 4.5 percent.  So, why this I-CRR? We will try and explain below.  Difference between I-CRR and CRR  I-CRR is similar to the CRR, wherein banks need to set aside a certain portion of their money with the RBI. They do not earn any interest on this. Likewise, with the I-CRR, banks need to set aside an additional 10 percent of the NDTL garnered between May 19 and July 28.  Why has the RBI announced the I-CRR?  The central bank has announced the I-CRR with an aim to manage the higher surplus liquidity sloshing about in the economy following the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system (after they were withdrawn from circulation).  \"This measure is intended to absorb the surplus liquidity generated by various factors, including the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system,\" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said at the press conference following the monetary policy committee meeting.  In the last few months, the liquidity in the banking system has risen sharply post the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 banknotes, the transfer of RBI's surplus to the government, an uptick in government spending, and capital inflows.  To mitigate this, the central bank has conducted various variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions of different tenures, but received a muted response from the banks, as they preferred holding on to the liquidity to avoid seeking funds later under the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF). The MSF allows banks to borrow from the RBI in emergencies at a rate higher than the repo.  Since June, the central bank has conducted 16 VRRR auctions for Rs 18 lakh crore. However, banks parked only Rs 7,73,023 crore in these auctions.  How much money will be parked in I-CRR?  Das said that per the RBI's internal calculations, a little over Rs 1 lakh crore will be parked in I-CRR, which will accordingly lower the surplus liquidity in the banking system, which currently stands at around Rs 2.11 lakh crore.  According to Esha Khanna, Associate Professor, NMIMS Sarla Anil Modi School of Economics, this move may slightly tighten the liquidity situation in the short term and affect short-term call rates.  How will it impact systemic liquidity?  Most money market dealers and experts said the I-CRR will have some impact on the banking system liquidity, but it will continue to be in surplus by over Rs 1 lakh crore for the next couple of months.  \"An ICRR of 10 percent can take out a little over Rs1 lakh crore from the banking system. Despite this, the system liquidity will remain in surplus by more than Rs 1 lakh crore for the next 1-2 months,\" said Pankaj Pathak, Fund Manager-Fixed Income, Quantum AMC.  But the I-CRR will impact short-term rates, which may harden by 15-20 basis points (bps).  \"We expect the short-term rates of money market instruments like treasury bills, call money rates, and commercial paper to increase by 15-20 bps in the near term,\" said Anil Gupta, Senior Vice President, Co-Group Head - Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA Ltd.  Will it impact lending and deposit rates?  Experts believe that there will be no major impact on the deposit and lending rates because the RBI Governor has said that the central bank will ensure there is adequate liquidity in the system.  \"We will ensure there is enough liquidity in the system for banks to continue lending,\" Das said during the conference.  Will RBI continue VRRR auctions?  Das also clarified that even though the central bank has announced the I-CRR, VRRR auctions will continue to be the main tool for draining excess liquidity.  \"VRRR (auctions) will continue,\" Das said, adding that the VRRR system will release about Rs 93,000 crore on August 10.\n",

      "In Charts | The declining popularity of engineering courses\n",
      "Engineering courses, which were once highly sought-after by students in India, seem to be losing their charm. The number of students enrolling in engineering and technology courses in the country has seen a steady decline in recent years, falling to 39.2 lakh in 2020-21 from 45.4 lakh in 2014-15, according to official data.  Data from the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) published by the Ministry of Education was shared in Parliament by Minister of State for Education Subhas Sarkar in response to a question asked on the matter.  \"The slight downward trend in enrolment from 2011-12 to 2020-21 may be due to the changes in preferences of students and the introduction of new courses having alternative job opportunities,\" he said, citing information from the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE).    Data from AISHE shows that Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Technology (B Tech) are the only major programmes at the undergraduate level that have seen a decline in enrolment.    As the number of enrolments has declined, the number of colleges offering engineering courses has also come down, with several of them shutting down in recent years. The number of AICTE-approved technical and engineering colleges has declined 9.02 percent between 2017-18 and 2023-24.    Lack of employability  According to data from the India Skills Report 2022, almost half of India's engineering undergraduates are not employable. The percentage of employable talent who completed BE or B Tech courses in 2022 stood at just 55 percent. Meanwhile, estimates by the World Economic Forum (WEF) show that only one in five engineering graduates from the country are employable.    Moreover, according to a statement made by former vice chairman of NITI Aayog, Rajiv Kumar, as many as 48 percent of India's engineering graduates remain unemployed.  Dearth of suitable jobs  A report by Aspiring Minds (now called SHL) shows that for most engineering graduates in India, finding the right company or profile to apply to is the biggest challenge in gaining employment, followed by clearing interviews.    Although around 95 percent of students have taken some sort of training to improve their employability, most did it in college itself.  More alarmingly, as many as 59 percent of the students surveyed said that faculty members don't talk to them about the industry applications of concepts covered in the curriculum.  The difficulty in finding the right jobs to apply for seems to extend to premier institutes such as the IITs as well. According to a study by the Centre for Policy Studies at IIT Bombay, between 2014 and 2018, around 60 percent of graduates from the institute took up non-core jobs, which refers to jobs in fields other than their branch of study.  The majority of students from all branches, except Computer Science and Engineering and Electrical Engineering showed a stronger preference for non-core jobs.\n",

      "Japan's BoJ miscommunicates with easy money policy under pressure\n",
      "With few exceptions, the most prominent central banks have retired from the business of providing detailed projections of where interest rates are headed. The costs of being wrong in an era of worrisome inflation were too great. Japan is trying something new: forward misguidance. Unsettling surprises are a feature of the choices the Bank of Japan has made over the past decade, rather than a bug. Dismantling ultra-loose money and the paraphernalia that has supported it means that communications accidents like the one that rocked global markets recently are bound to happen. If they were, indeed, an accident.  Investors should brace for more adventures on the road to less easy money. With inflation now off the floor - there are arguments about how much momentum prices have - the desired destination is likely an end to vigorous policing of yields on government bonds. And quite possibly, an end to negative official rates. That won't happen overnight, but the odds of a graceful exit are long. Market sensitivity to tweaks in BOJ policy is extreme because officials are seeking to directly manage the value of securities, rather than guide toward their view.  Few BOJ watchers predicted Governor Kazuo Ueda would let long-term market rates increase at the conclusion of the July 27-28 meeting. Ueda had used a dovish tone earlier in July, affirming at the meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers in India that things were set to stay the same. \"Unless the premise is shifted, the whole story will remain unchanged,\" he said. Reports from inside the bank seemed to back this narrative; more than 80 percent of economists expected no policy change, even a tweak.  That was until 2 am, Tokyo time, on the morning of July 28, when a story in the Nikkei newspaper hinted that rates on 10-year Japanese government debt would be allowed to go over 0.5 percent. It was the second time in Ueda's short reign that Japanese media appeared to be in possession of information from inside the gathering.  Even then, traders didn't have the full story, with the report carrying no mention of the 1 percent ceiling. When the official announcement hit after an interminable wait - the BOJ still does not give a time in advance for when policy will be announced, leaving dealers fruitlessly refreshing screens - it confused the market with its mention of three different levels for the 10-year yield (\"around zero,\" a 0.5 percent \"range\" and the 1 percent \"ceiling\" at which the bank would step in). Investors are still debating what the move means.  The July decision \"created too many interpretations, because it was just too complex and everybody understood it in a different way,\" former board member Sayuri Shirai said in an interview. \"I kind of expected that Ueda-san would be a bit clearer.\"  It's far from the first time the bank has struggled to communicate a change in yield-curve control. In fact, every single time the BOJ has changed the way it implements YCC, it has done so differently, going from an ambiguous range to a defined one, and now back to ambiguity.  In an era when communications are a central bank's foremost tool, the data-driven Ueda was meant to bring clarity. The shock-and-awe strategy of his predecessor, Haruhiko Kuroda, was deliberately designed to stun the market and show he meant business in a way that Masaaki Shirakawa, who led the bank before him, was widely judged not to have. But observers had tired of it by the end of Kuroda's long decade in charge. Now, Ueda faces the same credibility deficit.  While misunderstanding around the BOJ's policy partly reflects ignorance of how the bank works and the differing ways in which Japan's economy operates, Ueda has deepened distrust of whether the bank says what it means and means what it says. A recent comment illuminates this lack of clarity. \"There is no specific level in my mind at this stage,\" Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida said last week, in response to a question about when the BOJ would step into the market for 10-year bonds. But then he offered a telling comment: \"I mean, I wouldn't say it even if there was one.\"  The BOJ is likely sincere when it says the 2 percent price goal is still some way off, even if one member seemingly believes it's on the horizon. But the head fakes are making it difficult to know what it truly believes.  The need for circumspection, to put it charitably, may just be inherent in the whole YCC project. Krishna Guha, who covers global policy at Evercore ISI, has likened the approach to a shift in exchange-rate regimes. You never talk about it in advance for fear that speculators get too far ahead and, consequently, ruin the necessary element of surprise. There's something to that analogy. During the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis, the modus operandi of governments when faced with questions of devaluation was to deny or obfuscate. Same with Latin America in the following years.  There's a further comparison: capital controls. In the leadup to Malaysia's decision in September 1998 to slap restrictions on the flow of money out of the country, ministers would discourage discussion of the shift. Shirai is among those who argue that YCC itself was a fudge in the first place to make up for the deep unpopularity of negative rates, which she voted against in early 2016. The BOJ is still working to extricate itself from that decision.  Japan isn't about to have a currency or debt crisis; the BOJ itself owns a swathe of the domestic bond market after decades of on-again-off-again quantitative easing. But a communications crisis is something else. It would be a tragedy if the mistrust and skepticism that pervaded the end of his predecessor's second term come to define Ueda's tenure just a few months after taking the oath of office.  Such are the thrills and spills of unconventional monetary policy. Easier to get in than out.  Daniel Moss is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian economies.

      " MC Exclusive | Laptop, tablet import curbs to ensure trusted supply chain for digital economy, says Rajeev...\n",
      "The curbs on the import of laptops, tablets and other computing devices are being misunderstood to be harking back to the licence raj but the policy is aimed at ensuring a trusted supply chain for India's fast-growing digital economy, Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Moneycontrol in an interview.  \"This is certainly not an attempt to go back to the license raj. As we increase the digitisation of our economy, we certainly want to make sure that the elements of hardware that are going into the digital economy are all monitored and come from trusted sources,\" the minister said. \"In hindsight, this should not have been called curbs or licensing. This should have been called more of an import management system.\"  The Centre last week mandated a licensing requirement for information technology (IT) hardware in what is being seen as a bid to cut imports from China and give a fillip to the government's recently announced Rs 17,000- crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for such devices.  &amp;nbsp;  A day after it announced the curbs, the government on August 4 deferred the implementation of the decision to November 1 amid concerns that limited supplies could lead to a sudden spike in the prices of computing hardware.  \"In the three months that we have given to the industry, we are sitting down and working out a framework for how the government's goals can be met, without disrupting what is the current growth and ambition of these companies,\" Chandrasekhar said.  \"We want to work with industry as we have worked. We have done that in the smartphone category where there are global brands today that are using India as a very successful base.\"  According to industry estimates, 1.5 million of the 2 million laptops sold on a quarterly basis in the country are imported.  Exemption from the curbs will be provided to players only for up to 20 of such items per consignment for the purpose of research and development, testing, benchmarking and evaluation, repair and re-export and for product development.  PC and laptop makers such as Dell, HP, Lenovo and Asus are among those who will be impacted by these restrictions, say sector analysts, adding that many of these companies do have some sort of local manufacturing capabilities in India.  Apple, which imports its MacBooks to India, will also be affected. Mac sales account for about 9-10 percent of the tech giant's India business, slightly higher than the global average, as per industry estimates.\n",

      "RBI likely to delay rate cuts to Q2 of FY2025\n",
      "Despite sizzling prices of tomatoes and other food items causing consternation all around, a third consecutive pause from India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in its August 2023 policy review was a foregone conclusion. The policy posed very few surprises, with a unanimous vote to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent. The stance was retained at remaining focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth, with a vote of 5:1. While the sanguine growth forecast was expectedly left unchanged, the inflation forecast was pushed up to 5.4 percent, higher than our expectation (+5.3 percent). Further, the temporary imposition of incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) came as a surprise. As anticipated, the tone of the document was more hawkish than the June 2023 policy statement, given the rising uncertainties being posed by both food and crude oil prices, and a particularly erratic monsoon distribution, even though its eventual volume may well be in the normal range. The MPC highlighted that it will remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the target as well as anchoring inflation expectations. In line with the last two policies, the Governor once again stressed that bringing the CPI inflation within the tolerance band of 2-6 percent is not enough and the focus remains on aligning inflation to the target of 4.0 percent. In addition, he enunciated the concern that the frequent incidences of recurring food price shocks pose a risk to anchoring inflation expectations, adding to the hawkishness of this policy statement. Warning On Inflation The MPC also warned that the headline inflation is likely to spike in the immediate term given supply disruptions emanating from adverse weather conditions. No sooner than the market internalised that just falling below 6 percent was not adequate, the CPI inflation is set to cross this threshold resoundingly in the soon-to-be-released print for July 2023. We suspect that after the short-lived respite, the July and August CPI inflation prints will be in an uncomfortable range of 6.5-7.0 percent. No surprises then, that the MPC increased its baseline forecast for inflation for Q2 FY2024 by a huge one percentage point to 6.2 percent from 5.2 percent. Subsequently, it sees inflation moderating to 5.7 percent in Q3 FY2024, and then to 5.2 percent each in Q4 FY2024 as well as Q1 FY2025. Based on the latter, we no longer expect rate cuts to commence in June 2024, and have pushed our forecast for the earliest cut to Q2 FY2025. Moreover, we continue to anticipate the rate cut cycle to be fairly shallow, limited to 50-75 bps. At the same time, the MPC emphasised the need to be vigilant and to be ready to act appropriately to ensure that the effects of shocks do not persist. While it reassured that it looks through idiosyncratic shocks, it warned that if such idiosyncrasies show signs of persistence, then it would have to act. This does leave the door open for an intermittent rate hike, although the bar for that would be quite high. In our view, inflation would need to persist above 6.0 percent for at least two quarters, amid transmission of pressures to core inflation, to set the stage for a rate hike. Optimistic On Growth Notwithstanding external challenges and monsoon-related risks, the MPC remained fairly upbeat on the prospects for domestic consumption and investment. We are particularly enthused by the capacity utilisation figure of 76.3 percent for Q4 FY2023, and are cautiously optimistic about a sustainable and broad-based, albeit realistic, capacity expansion cycle setting in. Moreover, both Central and state government capex has moved well above pre-Covid levels in the last two years. While implementation will remain crucial, we do expect the government to continue to prioritise allocations for capex over the medium term, which would support the growth prospects.   As per our estimates, the measure on I-CRR will impound liquidity of the banking system of around Rs 900-950 billion. As a result, we expect the short-term rates on money market instruments like call money rates, treasury bills and commercial paper to jump by 15-20 bps in the near term. After the policy announcement, the yield of the current benchmark 10-year government security did waver, albeit in a narrow range. A new benchmark security is set to be unveiled on Friday. Amidst limited fiscal concerns and a high likelihood of an extended pause from the MPC, we foresee its yield in a range of 7.1-7.2 percent over the next two months. As a result of the measure to drain the liquidity overhang, the yield curve will likely flatten further in the immediate term.

      " RBI policy less hawkish, interest rates to remain high for next few months: Unmesh Kulkarni of Julius Baer...\n",
      "The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) rate decision in its monetary policy statement was pretty much on expected lines - status quo, as far as policy rates are concerned. Since the February policy, we have been expecting the RBI to be in an extended pause mode, and the current policy decision is in sync with our expectations.  The recent spike in food and vegetable prices has been a matter of concern for the near term, as it temporarily disrupts the downward trajectory of the consumer price inflation (CPI) that the RBI has been successfully able to achieve through its monetary policy actions and liquidity management. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has raised its inflation forecast significantly (by 100 bps) for Q2FY24 to 6.2 percent, which is beyond the 6 percent upper limit of RBI's tolerance band.  The MPC has also upped its CPI projections by 30 bps for Q3, and by an overall 30 bps for full FY2023-24. However, as we were expecting, the MPC has decided to look through the current spike in food inflation (caused by non-seasonal rains, El Nino, etc.), as it views this spike as temporary.  What is notable, however, is that the RBI has projected CPI for Q1FY25 (i.e., April-June of the next financial year) at an elevated 5.2 percent. Given the continuous reinforcement by the governor of the 4.0 percent median CPI target, the latest forecasts basically throw out of the window any rate cut expectations in FY24. Unless there is a significant deterioration in global growth that has spillover effect on domestic growth, it looks pretty unlikely that the RBI will change course during the current financial year.  Also read: In fight against inflation, MPC caught between a rock and a hard place  A bit of a surprise element in this policy statement was the introduction of the 10 percent incremental cash reserve ratio (referred to as I-CRR) on the net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of banks during the recent May-July period. The governor has acknowledged that the RBI's Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) auctions are not having the full desired impact on withdrawal of liquidity, which remains in surplus mode, as banks are preferring to park their excess liquidity in the SDF window instead of the VRRR window. The I-CRR measure is intended to be temporary (possible until 8 September) and non-disruptive; however, it is likely to move up the money market rates in the near term.  Overall, the RBI's policy tone continues to focus on maintaining a harmonious balance between containment of inflation on the one hand and supporting growth on the other hand, while keeping liquidity tight. Yield curves will continue to be flat in the near term due to the central bank's focus on tightening liquidity.  Also read: Should avoid knee-jerk reactions to inflation data, says Das  The policy, while appearing to be less hawkish compared to the previous one, pushes further back any expectations around rate cuts or even diluting the policy stance (from the long-standing 'withdrawal of accommodation'). Domestic interest rates will continue to remain high over the next few months, until there is visibility around resumption of the downward trajectory of the headline CPI, or growth conditions moderating meaningfully.  In the current scenario, investors can take advantage of the high interest rate regime and invest in short-medium term fixed income opportunities, while allocation to longer duration investments can preferably be staggered with a longer investment horizon in mind.

      "Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | MPC Decision: Salad Days\n",
      "Dear Reader,  A saying attributed to various people goes: &lsquo;Knowledge is knowing that tomato is a fruit, wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad'. Yet the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), to its eternal shame, said, \"Going forward, the spike in vegetable prices, led by tomatoes, would exert sizeable upside pressures on the near-term headline inflation trajectory.\" Clearly, they lack the knowledge that tomato is a fruit, indeed one that was supposed to have aphrodisiac powers, as evidenced by the French calling it pomme d'amour, or love apple.  The upside is that, by the same logic, the MPC members are unlikely to put tomatoes in a fruit salad, thus making up in wisdom what they lack in knowledge. That wisdom is seen in their determination to &lsquo;look through' the rise in food prices to the low inflation beyond and keep the policy rate unchanged, despite raising the retail inflation forecast for the current fiscal year to 5.4 percent, up from 5.1 percent projected at the last MPC meeting in June. Putting it another way, despite the widespread belief that tomato prices are a hot potato, the MPC thinks it is small potatoes.  That doesn't mean, though, that the RBI governor is as cool as a cucumber and he doesn't give a fig about tomatoes. He said, &lsquo;The frequent incidences of recurring food price shocks, however, pose a risk to anchoring of inflation expectations'. He added, &lsquo;We have to stand in readiness to go beyond keeping Arjuna's eye to deploying policy instruments, if necessary.' As my colleague Aparna Iyer points out, these instruments could include an increase in the incremental cash reserve ratio, which will affect liquidity.  While the inflation outlook is a bit of a lemon, the MPC is full of beans about growth. The growth forecast for FY24 has been retained at 6.5 percent. What's more, the RBI governor also said, &lsquo;The total flow of resources to the commercial sector from banks and other sources taken together has increased by ₹7.5 lakh crore during the financial year 2023-24 so far (up to July 28) as compared with ₹5.7 lakh crore a year ago.' That's an increase of 31.6 percent from a year ago, testimony to the strong growth momentum in the economy, in spite of the rate hikes by the central bank.  With that kind of growth momentum and with abundant liquidity, could there be a risk of inflation spilling over to the broad economy? The RBI took a small step in draining some of the liquidity, by a temporary increase in the incremental cash reserve requirement ratio to 10 percent. It's such an itsy-bitsy teen-weeny step that it reminded me of these lines from the famous song:   She was afraid to come out of the locker She was as nervous as she could be. Be that as it may, the RBI has reiterated that it is &lsquo;firmly focused on aligning inflation to the target of 4.0 per cent', which means that chances of any rate cuts this fiscal year are dim--the policy rate will remain high for longer.  Does that mean growth will slow? Well, interest cover for the listed non-financial sector and for listed manufacturing companies is much higher now than it was in the years before the pandemic. Rising interest rates don't seem to have held back growth or affected profits. And the government is certain to do all it can to reduce food inflation in the run up to the general election next year.   RBI governor Das also said investment activity has gained steam on the back of government capital expenditure, rising business optimism and revival in private capex in certain key sectors. Construction activity remains strong. Further, Das clearly said, &lsquo;Aggregate demand conditions continue to be buoyant.'  All that should support the markets, despite the temporary scare from tomatoes. For the Indian economy, it's still peaches and cream.

      "MPC Meeting: RBI stays focussed on cooling inflation\n",
      "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stood pat on interest rates even as central banks of advanced countries continue with rate hikes. The introduction of incremental cash reserve ratio to mop up excess liquidity created by the return of Rs 2,000 currency notes, which was not anticipated, could temporarily harden short-term rates. The RBI policy stance, however, did not come as a surprise to the markets.  Understandably, the rate hikes in advanced countries have been more aggressive as they are facing a steeper inflation challenge compared with India. The US Federal Reserve, for instance, has raised rates by 525 basis points (bps) versus India's 250 bps in the current hiking cycle. While the Fed's latest hike may well be its last for the current cycle, the European Central Bank is expected to continue tightening policy because inflation in its remit has been stickier.  Overall, interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer in the West given the headline inflation remains above redline and core inflation sticky. In contrast, the pressure on monetary policy in Asia has abated due to softening inflation.  Inflation Rebounds   The RBI's caution on inflation has stood it in good stead as inflation, which appeared to have peaked during the June policy announcement, has rebounded. Mint Road has been relentlessly communicating that the fight is far from over and the August policy review reiterates this stance.  In the face of strong economic growth in the first quarter, the RBI kept its forecast for India's GDP growth unchanged at 6.5 percent. But the recent spike in food inflation has created an upside to the RBI's July-September CPI forecast of 5.2 percent - a number it now sees rising to 6.2 percent. For the current fiscal, it expects the CPI inflation print to be 5.4 percent, or 30 bps higher than the June forecast.  Various indicators point to an overall strong growth momentum in the first quarter. Government investments have expanded at a fast pace and credit growth is quite healthy. The Purchasing Managers' Index was in the robust expansion zone and averaged 58 and 61 for manufacturing and services, respectively, during the four months ending July. Merchandise exports continued to contract for five months in a row, but that has not slowed down overall economic activity.  Interestingly, high growth is not the main reason for rising pressure on inflation. Rather food inflation is the culprit. In contrast to the services part of core inflation, which remains under pressure due to strong demand for services, the goods retail inflation is seeing a continued drop. Goods inflation, with one-third weight in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), plummeted from 12 percent in June 2023 over the same month last year due to sharp correction in input costs. The non-food part of the Wholesale Price Index, which is a proxy for input costs, fell on year in June.  Companies have passed on some part of the cost reduction to the end consumer and used the other to cushion profit margins. This trend is likely to continue through the year as suggested by the Business Inflation Expectation Survey from IIM Ahmedabad - average year-ahead inflation expectations of the firms remained within 4 percent for two consecutive months.  Additionally, fuel inflation is in low single digits due to the high base effect as crude prices continue to trail last year's levels. The continued rise in international crude prices does raise concerns on this front. The services component of core inflation, which has a 27 percent weight in CPI, did come down but has been sticky in the last few months.  Pressure From Food Prices  Food inflation, with 40 percent weight, is the idiosyncratic part of inflation. Inflation in cereals, pulses and spices is in double digits and vegetable prices have risen sharply due to shock from weather and pests. Vegetable inflation, where spikes are normally transitory and correct in around two months, is not a lasting worry. But foodgrain inflation could prove to be tricky due to domestic and global factors.  Our research shows that food inflation can be high even when the monsoon is normal. For instance, food inflation printed over 6 percent in three of the past four normal monsoon years. The risk to food inflation from excess rains is playing out in vegetables and delayed sowing. The possibility of a weak El Ni&ntilde;o, associated with dry conditions in the latter part of the monsoon season, was confirmed by Indian Meteorological Department recently.  From a global perspective, El Ni&ntilde;o is also a risk to crops in other major global producing economies, such as palm oil in Indonesia and Malaysia and rice in Thailand and Vietnam. Among these, palm oil is a major import for India. Currently, edible oil prices are lower than last year, but a global shock can reverse this. For the record, India imports 60 percent of its edible oil requirement. The concern about food inflation is evident in the pre-emptive steps the government is taking, such as banning some types of rice exports, imposing stocking limits on wheat, and market intervention at reduced prices.  In this milieu, we expect rate cuts early next year if current food inflation pressure proves to be transitory and headline inflation stays on the projected trajectory. Although the RBI's rate hikes cannot directly impact supply-side-driven food inflation, it becomes a concern if it sustains, spills over to other components, and steers headline inflation away from its target. Mint Road will, therefore, keep its eyes peeled on food inflation.  Dharmakirti Joshi is Chief Economist, CRISIL. Views are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication. \n",

      "Domestic passenger vehicles wholesales registered a 2.94 per cent year-on-year increase in July at 3,02,521 units, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers said on Thursday.  As per the latest data issued by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), dispatches of passenger vehicles (PVs) from manufacturers to dealers were at 2,93,865 units in July 2022.  Two-wheeler domestic wholesales were down at 12,82,054 units last month, as against 13,81,303 units in July 2022.  Three-wheeler wholesales were higher at 56,034 units, as compared to 31,324 units in the year-ago month.  Total vehicle dispatches across categories were at 16,40,727 units, as compared to 17,06,545 units in July 2022, SIAM said.  \"Though the passenger vehicle and three-wheeler segments are performing well, there has been a de-growth of two-wheelers in July 2023, compared to July 2022.  \"Overall, we expect that the positive economic environment, good monsoons, and upcoming festive season will support continued growth in the auto industry,\" SIAM President Vinod Aggarwal SIAM said.\n",

      "WeWork's glass walls are starting to close in\n",
      "When WeWork Inc finally went public in 2021, the hope was it would leave behind the excesses that were a hallmark of co-founder Adam Neumann's leadership and become a serious flexible workspace provider for the work-from-home era. This week's \"going concern\" warning included in the company's second-quarter results suggests the next 12 months will every bit as fraught as WeWork's near implosion four years ago. Absent effective remedial action or another capital raise, it could be lights out.  WeWork has terminated hundreds of real estate leases and slashed fixed costs and capital expenditures since its first disastrous attempt to go public in 2019; its workforce has shrunk by 70 percent and fripperies including the corporate Gulf Stream jet have been sold. A debt restructuring in March won additional breathing space by reducing its borrowings, lowering interest payments and extending maturities until 2027.  However, the firm still has an ugly balance sheet and continues to lose heaps of money, burning through an eye-watering $650 million in just the past six months and reducing cash reserves to just $205 million. WeWork has lost almost $17 billion since it was founded more than a decade ago.  Rectifying this situation in a depressed commercial real estate market will be tough: Tech clients are trimming budgets and WeWork generates most of its sales in the US and UK - chiefly in big cities like London, San Francisco and New York that have a growing surfeit of office space.  To be sure, building owners won't want such an important lessee to fail, leaving them with huge amounts of space to rent out all at once. Hence WeWork has leverage to renegotiate leases, some of which are coming up for renewal. (Canceling long-term leases isn't straightforward, however, and may require termination fee payments).  The company desperately needs to boost revenue via winning more tenants, but the opposite is happening: Memberships have declined 3 percent since December, while occupancy fell to 72 percent from 75 percent during the same period. Boosting membership prices is difficult due to competition with rival shared workspace providers such as IWG Plc, which gained as much as 10 percent in London trading on Wednesday after the WeWork announcement.  WeWork needs firm leadership, but instead finds itself with a vacuum: Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani and Chief Financial Officer Andre Fernandez both stepped down unexpectedly in May.  Mathrani was a reassuringly sensible adult in the room and, so far the company hasn't named a permanent replacement. Compounding the sense of drift, three board directors resigned last week due to a \"material disagreement\" regarding governance and the company's strategic and tactical direction, according to the latest accounts. The official acknowledgement that the company's cash reserves might not be sufficient to survive the next 12 months will further unsettle clients.  \"The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause members, landlords and others to choose not to do business with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations,\" the filing states. WeWork can't afford to lose customers as it might then have to refund their security deposits, further draining cash.  Shareholders were heavily diluted earlier this year when part of WeWork's debts were equitised &ndash; the stock has declined 98 percent since the listing. WeWork has little debt maturing soon, but its bondholders also aren't optimistic about a full recovery; its $164 million of 7.875 percent senior unsecured notes maturing in 2025 traded at just 33 cents on the dollar this week.  Although the debt restructuring cut the company some slack, almost $500 million of borrowings have a floating interest rate that has risen to 15 percent. The company's decision to draw $175 million from a $475 million Softbank Group Corp affiliate debt facility in July is also not reassuring - in May, former management had said there was no need, while conceding the company wouldn't reach cashflow breakeven until the second half of 2024.  The big unknown is whether majority owner Softbank will ride to the rescue again. The Japanese tech investor has lost a gargantuan sum - $12 billion since 2017, according to the Wall Street Journal - on its WeWork misadventure. Another bailout is unappealing - but without one, WeWork's prospects look bleak.  Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Europe.

      "The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is set to announce its decision regarding the Zee-Sony merger case today. The NCLT had initially reserved its verdict on the merger between Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Culver Max Entertainment (previously known as Sony Pictures Networks India) on July 10.  The Mumbai bench of NCLT, comprising H V Subba Rao and Madhu Sinha, had reserved the judgment after listening to objections from creditors such as Axis Finance, JC Flower Asset Reconstruction Co, IDBI Bank, Imax Corp, and IDBI Trusteeship who raised concerns about the scheme.  In December 2021, Zee Entertainment and Sony Pictures reached an agreement to combine their businesses. Subsequently, both media companies approached the tribunal to seek approval for the merger, having already obtained necessary permissions from the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), and other regulatory bodies like the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).  During Zee's Q1 FY24 earnings call, the management expressed optimism that the merger would be concluded smoothly. Punit Goenka, the CEO of Zee Entertainment, clarified that his legal situation and the merger were distinct matters. The company emphasized that, besides the provision affirming his role as an essential part of the merged entity, there were no other changes to the agreement's clauses.  Zee Entertainment had declared a merger with Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) on September 22. The announcement highlighted that SPNI had acknowledged the inclusion of Punit Goenka as MD and CEO of the combined company as a key aspect of the deal.  In a temporary order dated June 12, the Securities and Exchange Board of India had prohibited Subhash Chandra, chairman of Essel Group, and his son Punit Goenka from assuming directorial or major managerial positions due to alleged misuse of funds from Zee for personal gain.  The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) upheld SEBI's interim order, imposing a one-year restraint on Zee Entertainment promoters Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka from holding board positions in publicly listed companies, citing alleged fund diversion.\n",

      "Zee Entertainment expects gradual recovery in ad spends, pins hopes on festive period\n",
      "Media company Zee Entertainment is expecting gradual recovery in ad spends after the company reported 2.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in ad revenues at Rs 901.8 crore in the June quarter of financial year 2024.  \"We saw some green shoots in June and July. So, there are early signs of ad spends picking up esp in FMCG which is a 60 percent contributor. At this point of time, we are not in a position to give a robust growth picture. We expect the positive momentum to continue. In the festive season, we will see ad recovery,\" said Rohit Gupta, Chief Financial Officer of Zee Entertainment during an investor call.  TV channels saw a weak ad environment due to lower spend by new age and e-commerce firms along with muted growth in ad spends by FMCG companies.  On the merger front, the management said that they are awaiting an order from National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that will pronounce its order on Zee's merger with Sony on August 10.  \"Punit Goenka has clarified that his case and the merger are two different things. Apart from the clause which states that he is an integral part of the merged company, there is no other change in any other clause. We are hopeful that there will be no major impediment towards the conclusion of the merger,\" the company's management said.  Zee Entertainment on September 22 announced a merger with Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) with the company highlighting that SPNI had agreed that the appointment of Punit Goenka as MD and CEO of the company was an integral part of the deal.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India, in an interim order on June 12, had banned Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra and his son Punit Goenka from holding any directorial or key managerial position for siphoning funds from Zee for their own benefit.  The proposed merger of Zee with SPNI is at a \"very important juncture\", and its completion is \"in the interest of all stakeholders,\" Goenka told Zee employees in a letter dated July 17.  The completion of the Zee-Sony merger has been \"my top priority\", Goenka had stated.\n",

      "Staggered office timings, carpooling, and dedicated buses for employees are among the traffic-reduction measures suggested by the Bengaluru city police to companies in the city's tech corridor. This comes on the heels of Hyderabad implementing similar measures to deal with gridlocked traffic.  Bengaluru City Police Commissioner B Dayananda and senior police officials attended Samparka Divasa, an outreach programme preceding Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara's meeting with IT-BT companies on the Outer Ring Road, which is the tech corridor of Bengaluru.  The meeting took place at Ecospace Business Park in Bellandur on the Outer Ring Road from 11 am to 1 pm on August 9 with representatives from tech companies and the Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA) to discuss various issues, ranging from traffic management to safety.  MN Anucheth, Joint Commissioner of Police (Bengaluru Traffic), told Moneycontrol that they suggested several measures to ORRCA and tech companies to streamline traffic. These measures include staggering office timings, particularly for log-outs; promoting carpooling; facilitating dedicated buses for employees; providing cab parking within the campus; and introducing shuttle buses from Metro stations to offices.  \"Staggering office timings will help us streamline traffic, especially during evening hours. We don't intend to impose specific timings on them but rather encourage them to come up with suitable timings based on their internal assessments. This way, the log-outs of different companies won't coincide,\" he explained.  Cyberabad Police had also advised IT companies to practice work-from-home (WFH) and gradually stagger log-outs.  Anucheth said that they proposed dedicated buses for employees working on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) and emphasised carpooling to reduce the number of private vehicles on the ORR.  Moneycontrol had reported that 6.4 lakh employees commute daily between Silk Board and KR Puram, using 3.3 lakh vehicles, including personal cars and cabs.  Anucheth said, \"Private cabs are currently parked on the service roads of ORR. We've suggested allowing the creation of parking spaces for these vehicles within the campuses, given that they are used by their employees.\"  He also urged ORRCA to operate buses to the nearest Metro stations, similar to the Electronics City Industrial Township Authority (ELCITA), to provide last-mile connectivity to employees.  Anucheth said, \"Once the KR Puram-Byappanahalli section and Silk Board station (RV Road-Bommasandra) are operational, ORRCA and companies can conduct an origin and destination study to identify the catchment areas from where these employees are coming. This would enable the provision of first-mile, last-mile connectivity for employees.\"  While the KR Puram-Byappanahalli Metro section is expected to be operational by August-September 2023, the Silk Board station is likely to be ready by December 2023.  Dayanand said that managing Bengaluru traffic is a formidable task. \"Everyone seems to have opinions on traffic management, much like cricket experts. Strengthening public transport and ensuring pedestrian safety are crucial. In fact, pedestrians are more vulnerable to accidents. BMTC has nearly 40 lakh daily riders, so it should get more priority. Various agencies are involved in the city's mobility planning.\" He also invited tech firms to visit the Traffic Management Centre on Infantry Road to witness how they manage the city's traffic.  Dayanand told Moneycontrol that the interaction with ORRCA and companies was effective. \"The major issue was traffic, but we also explained our plans and sought their suggestions. We are also working on various initiatives to decongest the traffic,\" he said.  ORRCA was unavailable for comment.  Techies are victims in 90% cyber fraud cases: police  Meanwhile, S Girish, deputy commissioner of police, Whitefield division, said, \"Tech professionals are victims in over 90 percent of cyber fraud cases, underscoring the need for greater awareness. Recently, a techie fell victim to a Rs 1.5-crore cyber fraud. Instances of fraud, such as OTP fraud, part-time job scams, loan fraud, and investment fraud, are abundant.\" He further revealed that they receive numerous complaints about two-wheeler and laptop thefts from companies in the tech corridor.  Built in phases between 1996 and 2002, the 60-km ORR encircling a significant portion of the city aims to connect major highways for faster travel and reduced congestion in Bengaluru. However, the ORR's flawed design, coupled with the absence of parallel roads, means that a single truck breakdown, fallen tree, or waterlogging can bring the entire tech corridor to a standstill.\n",

WeWork India is backed by the Embassy Group, which holds a majority stake of around 71 percent in the firm.  The company, in its clarification to CNBC TV-18, pointed out that it emerged profitable last year despite the COVID-19 pandemic-related challenges. \"We ended FY23 with a revenue of Rs 1,400 crore and Rs 250 crore in earnings,\" it noted.  Also Read | MC Explainer: WeWork's bankruptcy warning and what prompted it  While WeWork India sounded optimistic about its business outlook, the company's parent entity on August 8 said there is \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to stay in business over the next year because of its financial losses and its need for cash, among other factors.  WeWork went public in October 2021 after a spectacular collapse during its first attempt to do so two years earlier - which led to the ousting of its CEO and founder, Adam Neumann. The company was valued at $47 billion at one point, before investors started to drop off due to Neumann's erratic behaviour and exorbitant spending.  The company leases buildings and divides them into office spaces to sublet to its members, which include small businesses, startups and freelancers who want to avoid paying for permanent office space.  But over time its operating expenses soared and it relied on repeated cash infusions from private investors. The company also said on Tuesday it is facing high member turnover rates. It said it plans to negotiate more favourable lease terms, control spending and seek additional capital by issuing debt, stock or selling assets.  WeWork's interim CEO, David Tolley, sounded an optimistic note Tuesday in the company's results for the second quarter, during which it lost $349 million.  \"The company's transformation continues at pace, with a laser focus on member retention and growth, doubling down on our real estate portfolio optimization efforts, and maintaining a disciplined approach to reducing operating costs,\" Tolley said.

      "India's total coal imports fell 1.82 per cent to 68.30 million tonne in April-June period of ongoing financial year, according to a report.  The import was at 69.57 MT in the same period a year ago, mjunction said in its latest report.  The import included non-coking coal, coking coal, anthracite coal, pulverised coal injection (PCI) coal, met coke and pet coke, it said.  During the period, non-coking coal import stood at 42.99 MT against 47.44 MT in the same period last year, while coking coal import was 15.89 MT against 14.61 MT imported a year ago.  In June 2023, the import stood at around 21.03 MT, down 25.21 per cent as against 28.11 MT imported in the same month last year.  India is among the top five coal-producing countries in the world. However, some parts of its coal requirement are met through imports as the country is also among the major consumers of the dry fuel.  For coking coal -- a key raw material used in steel making -- the country remains heavily dependent on imports.  Vinaya Varma, MD &amp;amp; CEO, mjunction, said, \"In line with expectation, there was a dip in demand for imports at the onset of monsoon, despite weakness in seaborne prices.

      "What's behind the contrasting investment trends in multi-cap and flexi-cap funds?\n",
      "Multi-cap and flexi-cap funds, which invest across large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks, have been witnessing contrasting trends in investments over the past three months.  As per Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) data for July, multi-cap funds witnessed net inflows worth Rs 2,500 crore while flexi-cap funds saw outflows to the tune of Rs 932 crore.  Further, over the last three months, multi-cap funds have seen investments of Rs 3,340 crore while flexi-cap funds saw net selling of Rs 1,317 crore.  Both multi-cap and flexi-cap funds work under the same mandate of investing across market capitalisations, albeit to different degrees. What's behind the difference in their fortunes?    New funds  Mutual fund houses in India have increased their focus on multi-cap funds in the recent past. Data available with AMFI shows that over the last year, there have been seven new fund offers (NFOs) of multi-cap funds, and four of flexi-cap funds. But why is that?  In 2020, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced new norms for multi-cap funds, mandating a minimum of 25 percent allocation each to large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks.  Also read | RBI MPC: Das calls for greater transparency to floating-rate loan borrowers  Soon after, the capital markets regulator launched a \"flexi-cap\" category, which didn't have restrictions on investing in large-, mid-, or small-cap stocks.  Consequently, most funds moved to the flexi-cap category, while a few remained multi-cap.  Today, there are 33 flexi-cap funds while the count of multi-cap funds increased to 18 as of July, with new fund launches.  Data shows that since January 2023, NFOs of multi-cap funds have collected total funds of Rs 4,439 crore, while flexi-cap NFOs have raised Rs 964 crore.  The multi-cap fund launches is one reason behind positive inflows into this category.  Allure of smaller-caps  Data shows that on an average, flexi-cap funds combined are 23 percent into mid-cap and small-cap stocks, against 55 percent by multi-cap funds. This higher exposure to smaller-caps has resulted in a better performance by multi-cap funds.    Data shows that over the past year, while flexi-cap funds have risen 15 percent, multi-cap funds have gone up 20 percent, resulting in higher investor interest in the latter category.  Also read | 3 RBI announcements that will turbocharge UPI, UPI Lite  \"The performance that mid-cap and small-cap spaces have given predominantly post COVID is probably prompting a lot of investors to consider multi-cap funds,\" said Harshad Chetanwala, co-founder of MyWealthGrowth.  Mind the risk  On the face of it, the multi-cap and flexi-cap categories might look similar as they both invest across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks. However, the regulatory mandate on their exposure to different market-caps makes them very different and changes their risk profiles.  \"There is no comparison between a flexi-cap and a multi-cap fund. Flexi-cap funds are pseudo large-cap funds, with one or two exceptions. On the other hand, multi-cap funds are a pure market-cap diversification category,\" said Kirtan Shah, founder of Credence Wealth Advisors.  In the flexi-cap category, fund managers have the flexibility to change market-capitalisation exposure based on their view of where the market is heading, an option that is not available to multi-cap funds.  \"This increases the risk element. In the last few years, mid-caps and small caps have generated better returns, but these are the places where the volatility could also be higher, plus large-caps are more or less stable. Further, I don't see interest in the flexi-cap category from investors reducing,\" said Chetanwala.  Also read | RBI's worry on inflation can impact debt funds. Here is what investors should do  Meanwhile, Shah suggests that most investors need to stick to the large-cap and flexi-cap categories. \"If at all somebody has some risk appetite, some allocation to information technology, pharma and BFSI (Banking, Financial Services and Insurance) funds will do well,\" he added  Keep in mind that in any circumstance, a 50 percent combined allocation in mid-caps and small-caps would be riskier than a flexi-cap fund and even a large and mid-cap fund.\n",

      "RBI's worry on inflation can impact debt funds. Here is what investors should do\n",
      "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), led by Governor Shaktikanta Das, chose to leave the policy interest rates unchanged.  Though the status quo was in line with market expectations, the MPC opted to raise the inflation target for the financial year, which may add to investors' worries. In this context, experts advise investing in debt funds investing in bonds, maturing in the short term.  Inflation remains a key concern  Though inflation came down to 4.3 percent in May 2023, the inflation numbers are expected to be higher in July and August. Food prices remain a key variable and can push up inflation. The possibility of El Nino impacting the distribution of rains, and, thereby, farm output, can further push up prices. Globally, food and crude oil prices have inched up. Price of brent crude oil went to $87 per barrel on August 10, 2023, from $72 per barrel on May 31, 2023. These indicate a possibility of upward movement in inflation numbers.  ALSO READ: 3 RBI announcements that will turbocharge UPI, UPI Lite  Accordingly, the RBI has revised the inflation expectation for FY 2023-2024 to 5.4 percent, which was set at 5.1 percent in the June MPC review. \"We have to stand in readiness to go beyond, keeping Arjuna's eye on the inflation front, deploying policy instruments, if necessary. I reiterate what I said in my June policy statement: bringing headline inflation within the tolerance band is not enough; we need to remain firmly focused on aligning inflation to the target of 4 percent,\" the Governor said in his address announcing the MPC review outcome.  As a temporary measure to deal with excess liquidity in the banking system, the RBI has also directed scheduled banks to maintain an incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19, 2023 and July 28, 2023. This will be done, effective from the fortnight beginning August 12, 2023. This will be reviewed on September 8, 2023 or earlier. The governor further maintained that the existing cash reserve ratio (CRR) remains unchanged at 4.5 percent and there will be adequate liquidity in the system to meet the credit needs of the economy.  ALSO READ: What NRIs must keep in mind when investing their money  How does that impact debt fund investors?  The RBI's commitment to control inflation indicates that it is in no hurry to cut interest rates. The bond yields are expected to remain at the current higher levels for a longer period. Deepak Agrawal, CIO, Fixed Income, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company, says: \"The RBI prefers to be in a &lsquo;wait-and-watch' mode to check if the recent food price inflation is getting generalised and prefers to keep rates on hold and to keep the monetary policy unchanged. The rate is likely to stay on hold for the rest of CY2023.\"  If the RBI reverses the I-CRR by September, with a view to infusing liquidity in the September review or earlier, then that should soften short-term bond yields, other things remaining the same.  Short-term bond yields in a sweet spot  The benchmark 10-year bond yield remained flat at 7.17 after the MPC announcement. This may go up by a bit, if inflation actually goes up, as Das said the RBI expects.  Here is why short-term bond funds are comparatively less impacted than long-term bond funds. Investments in long-duration bonds expose investors to interest rate risk. When compared to this, short-term bonds appear attractive as one and two-year bond yields quote around 7 percent.  Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist, CRISIL, says, \"Mint Road seems staunchly focused on keeping consumer inflation within the 4 percent target, while standing pat on rates and monetary policy stance. The introduction of an incremental cash reserve ratio could temporarily harden short-term rates.\"  ALSO READ: Property insurance across borders: Local firms better equipped to provide tailor-made policies  At present, it may not be the best time to look at debt schemes focusing on long duration. Instead, this could be an opportunity to look at debt schemes focusing on the shorter end of the yield curve.  What should you do?  According to the monthly data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), liquid and money market funds saw net inflows of Rs 51,938 crore and Rs 8,608 crore, respectively.  After witnessing a net outflow of Rs 14,135 crore in June (the end of the quarter), debt-oriented schemes received a robust net inflow of Rs 61,400 crore in July. This clearly highlights that investors are more comfortable investing at the short end of the yield curve. This can be a good time to invest in short-duration debt funds, if you intend to hold your investments for 2-3 years. For those looking to invest for less than a year, investments in liquid, low-duration and money-market funds can be considered. Such schemes can help investors to take advantage of the current high yields. Short-duration funds and money-market funds have given 6.46 percent and 6.62 percent, respectively, in the one year that ended on August 9, 2023, according to Value Research.  Ideally, one should match their investment timeframe with the duration of the scheme. Also, check the credit quality of the portfolio.  ALSO READ: Struggling With Financial Problem?

      " Manufacturing sectors get the attention of the fund managers lately. Of the six schemes that invest predominantly in manufacturing sectors, four were launched in the last one year or so ago. Quant Manufacturing Fund is the latest entrant in the category. Experts believe that these funds will benefit from the Indian government's &lsquo;Make in India' drive and a wide choice of manufacturing industries across market caps offers many cyclical investment opportunities.

      "Equity fund inflows dip 12 % in July, SIPs top Rs 15,000 crore for first time\n",
      "Open-ended equity mutual funds recorded a 12 percent decline in net inflow to Rs 7,626 crore in July as large-cap funds continued to grapple with outflows, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) released on August 9, showed.  Despite this, Indian investors remained disciplined in their investment approach with inflows into Systematic Investments Plans (SIPs) topping the Rs 15,000 crore for the first time ever, to touch Rs 15,245 crore during July against Rs 14,735 crore in June.  Despite the marginal fall in equity fund investments, net inflows remained in the positive territory for the 29th month in a row in July amid a bull run in the equity markets. In July, the BSE benchmark Sensex scaled 2.80 percent, while NSE Nifty 50 climbed 2.94 percent.  N. S. Venkatesh, Chief Executive, AMFI, said, \"The surge in retail investors' interest in mutual funds has translated into impressive inflows across scheme categories. The star performer this month has been SIP with an impressive 33.06 lakh new accounts registered and a record Rs 15,245 crores of monthly contribution. Moreover, the industry's assets under management (AUM) have grown by 25 percent on a yearly basis, underscoring mutual funds' significance in financialization of savings.\"  Also read | Retail investors prefer index funds over ETF while going passive: Motilal Oswal AMC Survey  Thanks to the surge in debt-fund-bound investments, open-ended mutual funds saw net inflows of Rs 82,467 crore, a 63-fold spike over net inflows of Rs 1,296 crore in June.    The overall assets under management (AUM) of open-ended mutual funds increased 4.50 percent to Rs 46.11 trillion in July from Rs 44,12 trillion in the previous month.  Bullish on small-caps  The net inflows into equity mutual funds were also driven by five new fund offers (NFOs), which cumulatively collected net assets worth Rs 3,011 crore during July.  \"The drop in net inflow in July from June could be attributed to some investors booking a profit with markets trading near all-time highs. Some investors would have also chosen to stay on the sidelines and wait for some rationalization to set in before they invest,\" said Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director - Manager Research, Morningstar India.  Also read | How depository participants, banks harass legal heirs and beneficiaries looking to transmit assets  Notably, the sharp rally in the mid-cap and small-cap segments has caught investor fancy. The segments saw net inflows of Rs 4,171 crore and Rs 1,623 crore, respectively during the month.  Indian investors have been investing in both the mid-cap and small-cap categories for a couple of years. The last time these funds suffered net outflows was in February 2021 and September 2021, respectively.  On the other hand, large cap-oriented categories witnessed net outflows to the tune of Rs 1,880 crore.    \"Large cap segment has delivered good performance in recent times providing investors a good profit-booking opportunity. Investors would have also chosen to prefer currently performing mid and small-cap funds over large-cap funds,\" said Srivastava.  Debt makes a strong comeback  After witnessing a net outflow of Rs 14,135 crore in June, (the end of the quarter), debt-oriented schemes received a robust net inflow of Rs 61,400 crore in July.  Liquid and money market funds saw net inflows of Rs 51,938 crore and Rs 8,608 crore, respectively.  Also read | Struggling With Financial Problem?

Srivastava added, \"Given the current interest rate scenario and uncertainty over the direction of interest rates in the country, it appears that many investors chose to stay cautious and continue to invest in categories with one year or less maturity profile, since they carry relatively lesser interest rate risk.\"  Gold funds shine  Domestic gold exchange-traded funds saw net inflows of Rs 456 crore in July. On a year-to-date basis, inflows into the category stand at Rs 453.55 crore. Flows had been subdued in recent months as prices had run above the key Rs 60,000 mark, making investors wait on the sidelines.

Also, with equity indices touching new highs in July, some profit booking in the equity space too could have diverted some flows into gold. This is in contrast to global trends where International Gold ETFs saw outflows in July,\" said Ghazal Jain, Fund Manager, Quantum Mutual Fund.\n",

      "Retail investors prefer index funds over ETF while going passive: Motilal Oswal AMC Survey\n",
      "As the number of takers for passive investing increases in the Indian mutual fund industry, the segment is witnessing some interesting trends. Though exchange-traded funds (ETF) emerged as preferred vehicles for passive investing in the USA, Indian investors are rather comfortable investing through index funds than ETFs.  According to a survey done by Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company (MOAMC), 87 percent of the respondents invest through index funds, while 42 percent of the respondents invest through ETFs.  MOAMC conducted the survey online during February-May 2023 and involved more than 2,000 investors across fund houses spread across the country. Around 56percent of the respondents were in the age group of 18-35 years, whereas 54 percent live in metro cities. Sixty-one percent of the respondents reported their annual income to be less than Rs 10 lakh.  Also read: How Recurring Deposits are a smart option without risking the capital  Around 61 percent of the respondents said that they invested in at least one passive fund. Low cost, simplicity and market returns were cited as reasons for choosing passive products. Over half of the respondents (53 percent) said they increased their allocation to passive funds in the last 12 months.  In India, there is no specific preferential tax treatment for investing in units of ETFs over units of mutual funds (including index funds).  Many investors do not have demat accounts and while transacting in units of ETF, the investors may suffer from poor liquidity as well as high impact cost. Index funds do not suffer from these issues and also allow systematic investment plans (SIP) for investors, who want to invest in a staggered manner.  In March 2023, monthly SIP inflows crossed the Rs 14,000 crore mark for the first time, staying above the Rs 10,000 crore mark for 19 months in a row. In June 2023, the contribution of SIP to inflows stood at Rs 14,734 crore, according to AMFI data.

The survey further highlighted that more than 80 percent of the respondents plan to hold their investments for more than three years.  Pratik Oswal, Head of Passive Funds, MOAMC said, \"Passive funds are widely popular in the US and have over 50 percent market share. We have started seeing similar trends in India over the last few years as well. With a market share of around 17 percent, we believe that there is ample runway for passive funds ahead. This survey provides insights into how investors think about passive funds. It also helps shed some light on the thought process behind investment decisions of Indian investors.\"  The mutual fund industry has seen an increased demand for passive funds over the last five years. The assets under management (AUM) of all passive funds put together stood at Rs 7 lakh crore as on March 31, 2023, compared to Rs 83,000 crore five years ago, registering a compounded annual growth rate of 54 percent.

      "At Rs 1.85 lakh crore, mutual funds see highest quarterly inflows in 4 years in April-June\n",
      "The first quarter of financial year 2024 started on a positive note, as open-ended mutual funds saw net inflows of Rs 1,84,789 crore, the highest in four years, with the fixed-income segment witnessing the lion's share of inflows.  As per the latest Morningstar India report, flows in open-ended funds started on a strong note during June quarter, with net inflows of Rs 1,23,613 crore in April, which dipped to Rs 59,879 crore in May and ended with a disappointing Rs 1,295 crore of inflows in June.  Meanwhile, assets under management (AUM) of the industry stood at Rs 44.13 lakh crore as of June end, up 13 percent over the previous quarter.  Flows breakdown  As per the report, net flows into equity funds have been positive over the past nine quarters even as the momentum has been dropping since the last few quarters. In the June quarter, net flows fell significantly to Rs 18,358 crore, compared with Rs 48,766 crore inflows in the previous quarter.  Also read | Why a separate healthcare fund is a must for those living with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's diseases  The total AUM of equity funds as of June stood at Rs 17.44 lakh crore, up by a sharp 15 percent since the last quarter. Equity funds form about 40 percent of the total open-ended fund universe.  Weightwise, both the largecap and flexicap categories continued to lead the AUM split with approximately 15 percent and 16 percent, respectively, followed by midcap with 13 percent.  On the other hand, net flows in fixed-income funds have been quite disappointing in the last few quarters. But the first quarter of FY24 saw net inflows of Rs 1.39 lakh crore, the second-highest quarterly inflows for the asset class.  Also read | Mutual Fund Folio decoded: How to streamline and manage your investments effectively  After six consecutive quarters, the asset class finally managed to turn the corner and see net inflows.  Only four out of 16 fixed-income categories witnessed net outflows in the quarter ended June 2023. The liquid fund category (Rs 79,908 crore) and money market fund category (Rs 29,519 crore) managed to garner the lion's share when it came to net flows during the quarter.  M-cap trend  The smallcap category saw net inflows of Rs 10,937 crore in the first quarter, the highest-ever quarterly inflows for the category. This was also the ninth consecutive quarter in which the category witnessed net inflows. The smallcap category witnessed the highest net inflows for the open-end equity asset class during the quarter.  The AUM for the smallcap equity category hit its peak of Rs 1.68 lakh in the quarter ended June.  \"Strong consistent net flows and favourable market conditions propped up the assets under management for the smallcap category to reach new heights,\" Morningstar India said in the report.  Also read | How Recurring Deposits are a smart option without risking the capital  Largecap funds saw net outflows worth Rs 3,359 crore during the quarter as against net inflows of Rs 1,981 crore in the previous quarter.  Next, the midcap category saw net inflows for the 10th consecutive quarter, wherein it managed to garner inflows of Rs 4,735 crore. Interestingly, during the quarter, the midcap category received the second-highest net inflows in the open-end equity asset class, only behind the smallcap category.  New kids on the block  Cumulatively, about 40 index funds were launched in the first half of calendar year 2023; of these, there were 31 fixed-income index funds and nine equity-based index funds.  In the quarter ended March 2023, passive index funds/target maturity funds garnered Rs 26,269 crore. The spike in flows in this segment could be attributed to the change in tax laws for the fixed-income mutual funds from fiscal year 2023-24, which takes away the indexation benefit offered to investors.  Also read | How much money do you need to retire comfortably?  Investors, therefore, largely chose to invest in these funds to avail the benefit of indexation before the end of the financial year.  With the change in the fiscal year from April, the amount of fixed-income index funds in the June quarter was muted.  In terms of fund houses, SBI Mutual Fund launched two open-end funds during the first half of 2023, namely SBI S&amp;amp;P BSE Sensex Index and SBI Dividend Yield Fund; the cumulative AUM of these two funds stands at Rs 4,583 crore, which is the highest among the launched funds.  HDFC, on the other hand, launched 13 funds, and the cumulative AUM of these funds stood at Rs 3,218 crore.  The overall open-ended mutual fund industry was well-diversified, and weightage-wise equity funds comprised around 39 percent of the total industry AUM, followed by fixed-income funds with 31 percent.

      "Mutual Fund Folio decoded: How to streamline and manage your investments effectively\n",
      "As simple as it is to invest in mutual funds (MF) these days, keeping track of your portfolio can become quite a task if you have too many investments and too many MF folios. But this can be avoided if you just know how to manage your MF folios.  What is an MF folio?  Mutual fund folio can loosely be compared to an account in a bank. One can have multiple accounts in a bank. Similarly, one can have multiple folios with a mutual fund house. Mutual funds also allow zero-balance folio. Simply put, if you sell all units of schemes held in a particular folio then it becomes a zero-balance folio. Such folios can be used again to invest in schemes of mutual fund schemes. Each mutual fund house issues a separate folio number. For subsequent investments, you are supposed to quote the same folio number if you want to keep your investment under one folio. Otherwise, a different folio number is issued. ALSO READ: FD rates for Senior Citizens: Banks that offer up to 9.1% interest on 3-year deposits  Nowadays, while creating new mutual fund folios, the fund house asks for KYC (know-your-client) details, contact details and nominations before allowing investments. If you fail to provide these or do not choose explicitly not to appoint a nominee, then the fund folios cannot be created. Be it a paper route or an online route, while creating a new folio, these inputs are must.  But in earlier days it was not the case. Many times investors initiated investments without keying in the right inputs. For example, some investors used to ask distributors to write the distributors' mobile numbers and email ids as the contact information. Over a period of time, such lapses can adversely affect the ability to transact. For example, the one-time password (OTP) sent for login into the portal or approving transactions may not reach the investor at all if the phone or email does not belong to the investor.  ALSO READ: Why a separate healthcare fund is a must for those living with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's diseases  Fixing the lapses  The capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has, over time, been tightening the operational aspects when it comes to investing in MFs. The mutual fund investors were asked to declare if the email and mobile numbers keyed into their folios belonged to them or their family members. If you have old folios without such details, then you need to fix them as soon as possible. Over time, fund houses and registrar and transfer agents (RTAs) got in touch with investors to set records straight in their MF investments.  As investors, you should make sure that the information and nominations in your folios are up to date. If your MF folio does not have a nomination or you do not explicitly opt out of it before September 30, 2023, then you will not be allowed to redeem, switch or register a systematic transfer plan or systematic withdrawal plan from such folios from October 1, 2023.  Managing folios  Some Do-It-Yourself investors prefer to create separate folios for each financial goal. For example, one may use a folio to fund a child's education and another for funding retirement. Sometimes from the point of view of operational ease, separate folios are warranted. One can have a single-holder folio and a joint-holder folio as well. Within a joint-holder folio, a maximum of three investors are allowed including the first holder. Joint holder folios can be operated by either or a survivor mandate or with a joint mandate. There is no restriction on how many folios you can have. However, to make it easy for you to track, keep the number of folios to a bare minimum, especially within fund houses.  Rupesh Bhansali, head-mutual fund, GEPL Capital, says, \"Consolidated account statement helps the investor with a list of all mutual funds investments. You can also sell trivial holdings in your MF portfolio and invest the proceeds in schemes that have meaningful weights in your portfolio.\"  While consolidating the folios the holding patterns need to match. For example, only those folios can be consolidated where the unitholder is a single holder. If the folio is in the joint names, then it can be consolidated only with those folios held in the joint names in the same order. A folio held in the joint name, let's say A and B, cannot be consolidated with a folio held in the name of A or held in the name of B or a folio held in the name of B and A.  ALSO READ: Recurring deposits (RDs) offer an alternative to equity SIPs for risk-averse investors  Viral Bhatt, Founder, Money Mantra, a Mumbai-based financial planning firm, says, \"Mutual fund folios at AMC level can be consolidated by writing to the fund house or registrar and transfer agent (RTA). Single folio at the AMC level helps you to track your investment better and the AMC or RTA to service you better. Since you get a single view of your investments, you can make better investment decisions.\"  Demat accounts  Demat accounts act as folios when the units are held in demat accounts. Many online platforms hold units in demat accounts to curb the hassle arising out of multiple folios. Those online platforms that do not use demat accounts to hold units of mutual funds show existing folio details to the investor when she opts to invest in a scheme of a mutual fund where she is already holding an investment. However, if your distributor is not offering you such a facility or you have some legacy investments or you are transacting on multiple platforms, then you should check the folios and update your contact details and nominees wherever applicable, at the earliest opportunity.\n",

      "Individual investors repose faith in MFs despite tough markets in FY23: SEBI report\n",
      "The share of individual investors, which include both retail and high net worth individuals (HNI), rose to 55 percent in the total assets of the mutual fund industry during financial year 2022-23, driven by continuous growth of systematic investment plan (SIP) accounts.  These individual investors' exposure in terms of percentage to total net assets of mutual funds stood at 52.7 percent during FY22, showed data provided in the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) latest annual report.  The rise in the unitholding pattern of mutual funds by individual investors came at the time when markets remained largely flat during the year.  Following two years of exceptional performance, Indian equity markets took a breather in 2022-23, with benchmark indices Nifty 50 and Sensex delivering negative of -0.48 percent and -1.76 percent, respectively, during the period.  The SEBI annual report also showed that the exposure of corporate and institutional investors in mutual funds fell to 40.8 percent during FY23 from 43.5 percent in the preceding period.

SEBI data showed that during 2022-23, an incremental 1.6 crore folios were added to the mutual fund segment, taking the aggregate number of investor folios to 14.6 crore.  \"Individual investors continued to hold dominant position in terms of share in total number of investor accounts and assets held. Individual investors accounted for 97.1 percent of the total folios while they commanded a share of 55 percent in the total assets during 2022-23,\" SEBI said in the report.  Further, this was further accelerated by the continuous growth of SIP accounts.  During 2022-23, 2.51 crore new SIPs were registered, taking the total number of SIPs outstanding to 6.4 crore with total assets under management of Rs 6.8 trillion as on March 31, 2023.

The rise in individual investor exposure could also be attributed to higher number of new fund offers (NFOs).  Data shows that the year 2022-23 witnessed an almost two-fold increase in new schemes as 361 new schemes were launched compared to 183 in the previous year. Of the total, 275 were open-ended schemes and 86 close-ended schemes.  How schemes mobilized funds  During 2022-23, both gross fund mobilisation and redemption witnessed upward trend compared to the previous year.

The report, however, did not provide a breakdown between debt and equity schemes, nor did it reveal how the different categories of funds performed during the past two financial years.  Dependent on market movements  The data in the annual report suggested that the performance of Indian mutual fund schemes was reflective of the prevailing market mood.

      "Top stocks that smart-beta funds rely on to max returns\n",
      " Smart beta mutual funds are gaining popularity slowly among Indian investors. They are the passive funds that aim to beat the traditional market-capitalization-weighted index. These funds aren't entirely passive. The choice of stocks is made by framing models that shortlist based on factors like low volatility, alpha, quality, value, equal weighing and momentum. Based on these factors, smart-beta indices are made. And the indices are churned once in a few months when the factors are run all over again, to update the basket. NSE India has launched 34 such strategy-based indices. Indian mutual funds offer 45 such smart beta index funds/ETFs (including seven equal-weight funds and two FoFs).

      "TVS Supply Chain Solutions IPO: Can the logistics major tower over peers?\n",
      "After almost 29 years, a TVS group company is heading for an initial public offering (IPO). On August 7, TVS Supply Chain Solutions announced that its IPO will be open for bidding from August 10 to August 14. The last TVS Group company to be listed was TVS Electronics in 1994.  TVS Supply Chain Solutions began operations as a part of the group under the name TVS Logistics before becoming a separate company in 2004.  Today, TVS Supply Chain Solutions, or TVS SCS, as a global supply chain company, provides end-to-end solutions to Fortune 500 companies across the world. The business is divided into two main components: Integrated Supply Chain Solutions and Network Solutions.  ALSO READ: TVS Supply Chain Solutions IPO records 36% booking on debut  Under Integrated Supply Chain Solutions, the company provides technology-based solutions for sourcing and procurement, integrated transportation, product management solutions, logistics operation centres and in-plant logistics such as finished goods and after-market fulfilment among others.  Under Network Solutions, it provides two types of services: Global Freight Solutions and Time Critical Final Mile Solutions, which include a variety of services such as spare parts logistics services, return, refurbishment and engineering support and courier services to B2B businesses, both large and small.  Translated, what this means is that, a manufacturing company, after having recognised its suppliers and customers, need not bother about how to get things \"moving.\" It can outsource the entire operations to TVS Supply Chain, which will pick up the raw material from anywhere in the world and get it to delivered to the company's factories, and pick up finished good and deliver to its customers, be it in India or abroad. All the works along the way, be it warehousing or booking containers for transport, or taking care of custom clearances, the company will take care of everything.  Now, we know India is likely to grow exports big-time, thanks to government's thrust and global companies' push to diversify their sourcing base beyond China, widely termed as a China-plus-one strategy. This obviously means more business for a company like TVS Supply Chain.  On solid ground  Analysts believe the company has the competitive strength to provide end-to-end supply-chain solutions. So far, the company has grown largely through acquisitions, about 16 acquisitions over the past 17  years.  Thus, it has both the domain expertise, and the global presence, which means it can replicate the know-how to future customers operating in a variety of geographies and industries.  Currently, TVS SCS has clientele in 26 countries across Europe, Asia (including India) and Australia.  According to a report by HDFC Securities, with the use of integrated, data-driven, end-to-end solutions, the company has been able deliver value to customer and gain their trust. This has mean high rate of repeat customers, which ensures a steady flow of business from existing customers, even as the company focusses on new customer additions.  \"Our unit of measure is a project or a contract; how many contracts do we have, what is the longevity of these contracts, and what is our renewal ability&hellip;We have a renewal rate of around 99 percent, and it is our ability to win new contracts, which is the focus,\" Ravi Viswanathan, Managing Director, TVS SCS, told Moneycontrol during a recent interaction. Recently, it added UK-based Centrica plc to its roster for \"supply chain transformation\". Like most of its deals, TVS signed the Centrica deal for 7 years plus.  Diversified portfolio  While the business opportunity for TVS is huge, and it has a replicable model in place, by the very nature of its business, it won't be immune to any headwinds in global trade, say analysts. This is what the Covid period showed. During Covid, the company's revenue hardly grew and the business made losses. Only in FY23, it could get back in the green with a profit of Rs 10,311.01 crore.  What saves the day for the company in bad times though is the fact that it has a diversified portfolio. Any slump in one particular industry or country may be off-set by growth in the others. \"The global supply chains were impacted and so were many of our customers like electronic components and auto manufacturers. Thankfully, our portfolio is fairly diverse. So we were able to manage the business effectively,\" it said. Currently, about 50 percent of TVS SCS business comes from manufacturing; 30 percent comes from non-auto and 20 percent comes from auto. Non-auto businesses include electronics, mining, alternate power, technology and consumer goods while within auto it supports both production and the after-markets. \"In many ways, our business model is a de-risked one. In spite of very strong economic headwinds in the western markets because of the war and inflation, last fiscal our business grew,\" the management recently told Moneycontrol.  Capital intensity  The past three fiscal years for which its financials are available, the company clocked losses in two years. Last fiscal, it recorded a net profit of Rs 41.7 crore as against a loss of Rs 73.9 crore in FY21. EBIDTA margin for FY23 stood at 6.68 percent. Return ratios were also unimpressive with ROE at 5.50 percent and ROCE at 7.64 percent.   .  The financial numbers at this point do not point to a very profitable business, although the management boasts of an &lsquo;asset-light' model and says that it is striving for a double digit EBIDTA by in the next few years. Being asset-light means that the company does not own any its fleet, containers or warehouse space, all of which is great because it means the capital requirement for the business is not too much. It leases warehouses and vehicles and has complete control over control over the capacity and fleet. The scheduling, routing, storing, and delivery of goods are managed by the company, which enables it to maintain control over operational quality metrics while keep things flexible to suit customer requirements.  Yet, the asset-light model is largely seen as a good model, a HDFC Securities report says that the company's high dependency on third parties and network partners for warehousing and transformation, could impact operations, financials and cash flows. Besides, the company's freight, clearing, forwarding and handling charges, and manpower expenses (comprising employee benefit expenses, sub-contracting costs and casual labour charges) constitute a significant portion of its operating expenses, which means any increase due to any internal or external factors may also adversely affect kits financials. While these are usually passed on to the clients, it may not always be possible, and depends on what the contracts provide for. Another challenge HDFC Securities points out is its exposure to foreign currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency could impact both its revenue and borrowings.  India opportunities  While a lot of its presence is international, the growing supply chain market in India and the absence of a large-scale player of its size could be of advantage for TVS SCS in the domestic market, and most analysts believe that's what makes the company stand out is its diverse set of services with no like-to-like peer in the market. Currently, a large portion of the third-party logistics market in India is highly disorganised.    Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom, said, \"TVS SCS has the edge of large institutional clients, scale and expanse and the ability to provide end-to-end solutions which no other company does. This definitely has its advantages, including ease in creating synergies across different points in the supply chain process.\"  Indeed, the logistics industry in India is expected to grow to $385 billion by FY2027 at a CAGR of 13 percent from FY2022 driven by favourable macroeconomic factors, growth of outsourcing in the Indian logistics sector, and government policies encouraging manufacturing and consumption such as the PLI scheme. Over the last couple of years, on the back of the China Plus One strategy by global companies, the government has been encouraging domestic manufacturing. Analysts believe this could be an additional advantage for the segment.  IPO in focus  TVS SCS had initially announced its intention for an IPO last year but it was reported that this was postponed keeping market conditions and investor sentiments in mind. Through the IPO, the company, which is being valued at Rs 9,200 crore, plans to raise around Rs 600 crore from fresh issue as against Rs 2,000 crore decided earlier. The funds raised, according to the company, will play an important role in helping it overcome past challenges associated with debt. Similarly, it has cut its offer-for-sale to 14.23 million shares from 59 million shares planned earlier. The fixed price band for its initial public offering is Rs 187-197. At the higher end of the issue price, the company is valued at a market-cap of Rs 8,750 crore. The issue is priced at 10.5 times based on its net asset value of Rs 18.89 as of Mar 2023.  Considering the company's pedigree with the TVS group, which is seen as a shareholder-friendly group, and the tremendous growth opportunity, the stock seems to have the potential to ride the growth wave and create wealth over the long haul. But in the short to medium term, this may not be a great bet. Karkera says he sees good potential for the stock, amongst larger institutional investors. \"The sector warrants a lot of institutional interest and these investors are willing to take a longer-term risk on the sector which is in an expansion mode,\" he said.\n",

      "Hike's Rush Gaming Universe axes 55 jobs as 28% GST bites\n",
      "Rush Gaming Universe, a casual skill gaming platform from Kavin Bharti Mittal's Hike, is laying off around 55 employees, of which 24 are non-full time employees. This makes it the latest casualty of the government's 28 percent GST on the real-money gaming sector.  These cutbacks represent about 22 percent of the company's workforce, Mittal told Moneycontrol.  \"Business is in best shape ever. This 400% increase in GST is a bazooka pointed at us. We'll need to absorb some of it,\" Mittal said.  This follows the recent layoffs of 350 employees by esports and skill gaming unicorn Mobile Premier League (MPL), which represents about 50 percent of its India workforce, Moneycontrol reported on August 8.  On August 2, the GST Council decided to stick to its initial proposal of levying 28 percent on the full face value of real-money games, without distinguishing between games of skill and chance, despite suggestions from a handful of states to review it.  However, the council offered these firms partial relief by recommending that the GST be levied on the total amount of money deposited by users to play real-money games, rather than on each bet, to prevent double taxation. The council also agreed to review the levy six months after implementation.  Industry executives and other stakeholders say the proposed tax rules will increase a company's tax burden by 350 percent-400 percent, thereby severely impacting the growth trajectory of the sector.  WinZO co-founder Saumya Singh Rathore recently said that the fast-growing casual, quick continuous gameplay model will be hit dearly as nearly 70 percent of deposits are withdrawn by the players as winnings.  Due to low margins in this format, 28 percent GST on deposits would be \"two times the operating margin, leaving the companies in a bleed/loss-making mode,\" she said.  \"...we are looking at a threat to the much-admired sunshine sector and a threat to innovation that created a category that is now 60 percent of the online gaming market in India - the casual gaming sub-sector,\" Rathore said.  Sachin Yadav, the co-founder of a real-money based gaming company Quizy also recently took to LinkedIn to announce that they were shutting down the company, stating that the recent GST changes have thrown \"significant challenges our way\".  In June 2023, Rush Gaming Universe had claimed to have crossed the Rs 2,500 crore mark in annualised gross revenue in two years of its launch. It claimed to have clocked fourfold growth over the past 12 months and was operationally profitable since October 2022. It claims to have 5.2 million monthly active users.  Hike counts Tiger Global, Tencent, Polygon, JumpCrypto, Tribe Capital, Republic, and individuals such as Rajeev Misra, Arjun Sethi, Aditya Agarwal, Elad Gil, and Mark Pincus among its investors.\n",

      "Startups hike salaries by 8-12%; stock options gain ground: Report\n",
      "Startups in India offered salary increases in the range of 8 to 12 percent for the current year, while entry- and mid-level employees got the highest hike of 15-20 percent, according to a report.  The performance continued to hold 50 percent of the weightage in increments, and taking on additional responsibilities and getting a promotion factored in about 20 percent, according to Elevation Capital's Startup PayPulse Report 2023.  Other aspects were new assignments/career progression (15 percent), inflation and market competitiveness (10 percent), and unspecified factors (5 percent).  For leadership roles such as CXOs and function heads, the report highlighted that exploring stock-based increments turned out to be more appropriate while also planning to reassess the cash component in a few quarters.  \"We found that 50 percent of companies were looking at offering additional equity grants, largely in response to the subdued cash increments. While many of these companies are still in the deliberation phase, a portion of them has already moved forward with the decision to offer these equity grants,\" Kallan H, VP of talent at Elevation Capital, told Moneycontrol.  ALSO READ | Ghost jobs haunt candidates amid a spooky job market  To be sure, 25 percent of the startups deferred salary increments by one or two quarters. Performance payouts or variable bonuses were 50-100 percent of an employee's variable component. However, companies did not apply any multipliers to these payouts.    While employers prefer a hybrid model to permanent in-office work for their staff, they are still formulating a structured approach to this. Employers may let their staff work remotely for 40-50 percent of the workweek.  ESOP trends  Among the companies, 80 percent offered an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) with a vesting cycle of four years, while the remaining had a vesting period of more than four years.  ESOP allocation typically constituted 10-50 percent of the cash component offered to candidates for entry to mid-level roles in startups ranging from Seed to Series B stages. Those in leadership positions received ESOPs ranging from 0.2 percent to 1.5 percent of a company's equity. Additionally, they were increasingly considered a tool for increments for leadership roles in 2023.

      "CarTrade's profits surge on low base, revenue grows marginally by 5%\n",
      "CarTrade Tech, the automobiles classifieds platform, saw its net profit surge 400 percent to Rs 12.99 crore in Q1FY24, up from Rs 2.56 crore it registered in the same quarter last year, regulatory filings with the BSE showed.  To put it in to context, the jump in profit comes on the back of a small base.  Last month, CarTrade said it will acquire a 100-percent stake in Sobek Auto India Private Ltd, the arm which operates OLX India's auto sales segment from OLX India B.V for Rs 537.43 crore. The company's shares surged nearly 15 percent in early trade on July 11 in response.  The surge in profits came even as CarTrade's revenues increased marginally by about 5 percent to Rs 86.1 crore in the June quarter from Rs 82.7 crore in the same period last year.  \"I am happy to report that we are amongst a few internet companies that continue to grow and are profitable. In Q1 FY24, we achieved quarterly revenue of Rs 106.91 crores which is an 18% Y-O-Y growth. Our PAT for Q1 FY24 stood at Rs 13.51 crores representing more than a 300 % Y-O-Y growth and continues to outpace our revenue growth, as we have an asset-light and scalable business model,\" said Vinay Sanghi, Chairman and Founder, CarTrade Tech.  On a sequential basis, CarTrade's revenue of Rs 86.1 crore in Q1FY24 was a fall from Rs 95.9 crore that the company recorded in Q4FY23. Even its profits were lower on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis. While it earned a profit of Rs 12.99 crore in the June quarter, that was still lower than Rs 14.95 crore that CarTrade earned in the March 2023 quarter.  \"Our robust brands manifest their strength by being leaders in Google Trends and in our huge average monthly unique visitor count of 34 million, 85% of which originates organically,\" Sanghi added.  The company, which operates through various brands including CarWale and AutoBiz, saw its earnings per share (EPS) increase to Rs 2.77 in the three months to June 2023, from Rs 0.55 in June 2022.  Earlier this year, CarTrade Tech launched CarTrade Ventures and plans to invest Rs 750 crore in the next 5-7 years to fund acquisition and investment in the automotive space under this business initiative.\n",

      "BGMI maker Krafton to invest $150 million on Indian gaming and entertainment startups\n",
      "Krafton, the maker of popular battle royale title Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), on August 10 pledged to invest $150 million in Indian gaming and interactive entertainment startups over the next two to three years as the company looks to capitalise on the country's rising potential as a global gaming hub.  This follows the firm's earlier $140 million investment across 11 Indian startups since March 2021. With the new corpus, the South Korean gaming giant's total commitment to the Indian gaming and tech startup ecosystem now stands at about $290 million, making it one of the most prolific strategic investors in the country in recent times.  The announcement also comes at a time when top global and domestic tech investors such as SoftBank, and Tiger Global have tightened their purse strings amid an uncertain macroeconomic climate.  Krafton started its startup investment journey in India with esports firm Nodwin in March 2021. It typically invests in Series A to Series B stage startups in gaming and entertainment-based sectors such as Esports, multimedia entertainment, content creation and audio platforms.  In recent months, the company has expanded its scope to include the creator economy and consumer-facing deep tech startups.  Among its portfolio companies include mobile game development studios Nautilus Mobile and Lila Games, game streaming platform Loco, Indian language storytelling platform Pratilipi, and audio content platform Kuku FM, besides Nodwin.  Audio romance and friend discovery startup FRND, conversational media platform Bobble AI, music NFT marketplace FanTiger, in-game NFT exchange GGX and influencer marketing platform One Impression are also part of Krafton's startup bets in the country.  Where will the investment go?  Sean Hyunil Sohn, CEO, of Krafton India told Moneycontrol that they are currently scouting for startups with deep tech capacity (deep learning and AI) which can change how content creation works and how content platforms work for Indian consumers.  \"We firmly believe in India's potential as a key player in the global gaming and technology industry. We are dedicated to having a transformative impact not only in the gaming and tech industry but also in the wider content landscape\" Sohn said.  Krafton intends to allocate at least one-third of the $150 million corpus towards existing companies for their future growth initiatives, and another one-third towards deep tech companies that can provide differentiated services and offerings to consumers, he said. The remaining one-third will go towards other new startups, he said.  \"We are not as mature as a growth stage investor, but not as early as seed stage one. We are positioning ourselves in this sort of area where the startup has proven the product market fit, and revenues have started to kick in, but they need a sizable funding to speed up the growth\" Sohn said.  That said, he mentioned that they are selective with new deals since they prefer having a relationship with founders and are not passive investors in a company. \"We generally prefer to have at least 10% of the shareholding in the company and then we want to sit on the board, we want to be more proactive in terms of advising them and introducing new business development opportunities,\" he said.  Krafton, which has already invested in early-stage venture capital funds such as Lumikai and 3one4 Capital, is currently looking for similar VC fund investment opportunities in the country, Sohn said.  Earlier this week, Japanese mobile entertainment giant Mixi also launched a $50 million corporate venture capital fund dedicated to the India market. The fund will look to back early-stage startups in the gaming, digital entertainment, and consumer services sector in the country.  Meanwhile, Lumikai launched its second fund in June 2023 with an aim to raise $50 million to back early-stage gaming and interactive media startups in the country. It also set up a dedicated $10 million AIF (Alternate Investment Fund) for Indian limited partners to attract domestic Rupee Capital. This will bring Lumikai's total assets under management (AUM) to $100 million.  Also Read | Indian gaming studios see big action in 2022; take bolder, ambitious bets  India has been dubbed as the fastest-growing games market in Asia, both in terms of revenue and gamers, with its mobile and PC gaming revenue projected to reach $704.5 million in 2022, according to Niko Partners, a market research and consulting firm that covers video games, e-sports, and streaming in the continent.  This is set to grow at a five-year compound annual growth rate of 21.1 percent to touch $1.4 billion in 2026. This does not include revenue generated by real money games. About 34 percent of gamers in India spent money on non-RMG titles in 2022, the firm said.  India's overall gaming industry revenues increased from $2 billion in FY21 to $2.6 billion in FY22 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 27 percent to $8.6 billion in FY27, as per a report by Lumikai.   A quick snapshot of India's video gaming market  Expansion of India games portfolio  Krafton also recently expanded its portfolio of games in India in the country with the launch of Defense Derby, a real-time strategy game developed by its independent studio RisingWings.  With this launch, Krafton now offers four titles in India that include a real-time strategy game Road To Valor: Empires, and a battle royale game New State Mobile, apart from BGMI.  \"The metrics that we are seeing from Indian gamers are very different from global gamers. It's kind of a tough journey\" Sohn said.  For instance, Sohn said some games which have worked reasonably well in other markets haven't necessarily worked in the same way in India.  \"I think Indian people are a bit conservative or less familiar with a new gameplay or a new genre. In my humble opinion, Indian people spend most of their gaming time in Ludo or some kind of card and board games, and BGMI or other battle royale games. These games may account for more than 50 percent of people's gaming time here. But I believe that there is huge potential with strategy games, racing games\"  Although they are a global gaming company, Sohn said they intend to become a local publisher who can \"bring global games or new games from India which can open eyes for gamers. It cannot work overnight but we will continue to learn\"\n",

Also read: Classplus is overvalued, Unacademy's Gaurav Munjal says citing Graphy's growth  The controversy traces back to late 2021 when the founders of Saarthi and Classplus first engaged. In October of that year, an acquisition proposal was presented, with seemingly advantageous terms for Saarthi.  The talks began in 2011 and as per the deal, business operations and employees from Saarthi would be moved to Classplus. While initially, Saarthi's Kapil took up an executive role at Classplus, the company said matters started to go downhill from there when Kapil's role was terminated.  \"Furthermore, investors associated with Saarthi have not received their stipulated agreements or the corresponding equity they were entitled to. Both Kapil and the aggrieved investors have lodged legal and criminal complaints, naming Classplus and its founders, Mukul Rustagi and Bhaswat Agarwal, along with the Chief Financial Officer, Sankalp Aggarwal, as the responsible parties,\" the company statement said.  Tiger Global-backed Classplus was valued at over $600 million in 2022 and sells software to educators and coaching centres, among others.  Classplus is also backed by Peak XV's Surge, Blume Ventures, Alpha Wave, and GSV Ventures.  Both Saarthi and Classplus have submitted their responses in the Delhi High Court, and the next hearing is scheduled for September.\n",

      "Why L&amp;T's AM Naik chose to be a manager and not an entrepreneur\n",
      "Anil Manibhai Naik (81), the Non-Executive Chairman of Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;amp;T), said he is not mentally geared for starting anything small, looking back at his six-decade-long career leading the construction behemoth.  Talking exclusively to Moneycontrol ahead of his last annual general meeting (AGM), he said that when he decided to start an IT business, which was completely different from L&amp;amp;T's core business, he had the company's backing.  \"If I had to start IT on my own, I would have to create a small start-up, and I am not mentally geared for starting anything small; anything less than a billion is not on my mind,\" Naik told Moneycontrol in a recent interview.  Naik said that while ownership has not been an aspiration for him for the longest time, keeping him away from the entrepreneurial journey, the many hospitals and schools that he has set up give him the satisfaction of creating something.  Also read: MC Interview | India needs to focus on speed and scale; hopeful of L&amp;amp;T's future: Chairman AM Naik  One of the tallest leaders of India Inc, Naik has been credited with single-handedly growing L&amp;amp;T and shielding it from takeover bids. He has been the mastermind behind the many diversifications of the $23-billion engineering major.  Naik said he was unstirred in the face of such challenges, for, he said, they were a driving force throughout his career.  \"The most challenging times were 2003 and 2004. Did that give me sleepless nights? Maybe one or two nights would go sleepless, but otherwise, I slept well because I looked at every challenge as a hobby and I enjoyed it. Without challenges, I am a little unhappy, and I get tense,\" he said.  Naik, who chose to become a manager over an entrepreneur, advises start-up founders not to rush into their ventures, as haste may lead to failure.  \"In general, I want to advise them not to rush into anything just because they want to be another billionaire. Everyone doesn't become a billionaire; eight out of 10 may not succeed. They don't succeed because they rush without proper study on what they are starting and how they can stand up to others who are anyway doing the same thing in South America, China, Japan, or the US,\" Naik told Moneycontrol.  Naik was born on June 9, 1942, in Gujarat. He holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya Engineering College, Gujarat. His father, Manibhai Nichhabhai Naik, was a freedom fighter who quit his job in a Mumbai school to contribute to rural India.  \"I was not an IIT graduate because my father went to a village, but destiny brought me to L&amp;amp;T. I believe the best students of second-level colleges are better than the bottom quadrant of first-level colleges,\" said Naik.  According to the L&amp;amp;T head, the company also largely depends on training talent from mid-tier engineering colleges and not &lsquo;flying engineers who will go to other industries.' Naik said that today, the whole industry has sourced professionals from L&amp;amp;T.  The L&amp;amp;T chief, who has been made Chairman Emeritus, pegs L&amp;amp;T's next phase of growth on its talent, leadership, and entrepreneurial thinking.  \"When the opportunities come, we must know which one to pick. We should never do anything that will be less than $1 billion, even if it looks small now. Scale and speed will be important. You must create a size that is economically viable and make sure that you are ahead of the competition,\" Naik added.\n",

      "SoftBank invests most in four quarters, restarts &lsquo;careful' investments with focus on AI\n",
      "SoftBank Group Corp invested the most in four quarters, transitioning its strategy from a defensive to an offensive approach with an increased focus on artificial intelligence (AI) amid a rebound in shares of technology companies globally.  SoftBank, on a group level, invested $1.8 billion in the three months to June, most since April-June last year, when it invested about $2.5 billion, its Chief Financial Officer, Yoshimitsu Goto said during the earnings presentation on August 8.  Through the company's Vision Fund Unit, which includes the two Vision Funds and one Latin America Fund, SoftBank invested $900 million, more than two times compared to the same quarter of last year, when it invested about $400 million.  \"We have been carefully, carefully restarting our investment activities. I hope you get the sensitivity here that we are carefully and slowly moving back to investment activities,\" said Goto.  \"The investments that we have done so far, have been selectively considered and at the same time with a focus on the AI trend. For future growth, we would like to start having a good relationship with those companies that we hope are the future of the group,\" he added.  Goto's talk commenced with a slide labelled \"signs of change,\" where he delved into the surge observed in technology stocks recently. This surge brought about a reason for celebration at SoftBank, known for its investments in tech enterprises. Another slide, titled \"shifting to offence,\" was presented. Nevertheless, Goto's demeanour did not exude a high level of confidence as he continued saying that the company would take a very careful approach when it comes to investments.  Goto also emphasised how SoftBank's portfolio companies across sectors such as frontier tech, edtech, health tech, logistics, proptech and fintech among others, could potentially use generative AI. For instance, he said Delhivery, a logistics unicorn, could use generative AI for route optimisation.  SoftBank's positive outlook on AI and the gradual resurgence of investor interest are set to ignite hope within the realm of Indian startups. This resurgence hints at the potential return of one of the country's most assertive late-stage investors, which had refrained from investments for a span of 15 months.  India stands as SoftBank's third-largest market, trailing only the US and China. Nonetheless, Navneet Govil, a top executive in the Vision Funds unit, emphasised that the bar for investment is \"very high.\"  SoftBank, one of the most active tech investors in the world, has been reporting a loss for three consecutive quarters. However, its loss narrowed significantly in the June quarter to $3.3 billion, thanks to its Vision Fund investment unit, through which it makes investments in high-growth technology companies across the globe, making a gain on investments during the period, for the first time after five quarters.  Between the two segments of the Vision Fund investment units, the fair valuation of SoftBank's portfolio companies listed on the market rose from $24.9 billion as of March 31, 2023, to reach $25.4 billion by the close of the June quarter.  Concurrently, the fair value of SoftBank's private portfolio companies, which constitute a substantial portion of their investments, witnessed a marginal increase to $61.3 billion by June 30, as opposed to $60.5 billion in the previous quarter.  While SoftBank has not participated in any investments in India this year, the Japanese investor has been paring stakes in public companies like Paytm (One97 Communications) and private startups like Lenskart.  In fact, Paytm, one of SoftBank's biggest investments in India, turned breakeven for the Japanese investor, for the first time since its listing in November 2021 following a sharp rally in its stock, Moneycontrol reported in July. SoftBank is also looking at paring its stake in food tech unicorn Zomato via open-market transactions, thanks to the company's share price also rising due to improved financial performance.\n",

      "ZestMoney gets a lifeline, existing investors infuse capital\n",
      "Fintech firm ZestMoney's existing investors such as Quona Capital, Omidyar Network India, Flourish Ventures, Zip, and Scarlet Capital have pumped in funds, months after its sale fell through and the founders exited the firm.  The fresh capital infusion will give the embattled buy now pay later startup, bereft of funding and founders, a much-needed lifeline, as it aims to become profitable.  \"The new funding will support the business as it drives towards profitability, and the company's investors, made up of leading international and Indian fintech investors, are excited about its next chapter,\" the company said in a prepared statement on Tuesday.  Talking about the runway available for ZestMoney, the statement said that it gave enough funding to get to profitability soon.  \"Anything more is welcome to further drive our growth moving forward. The current round raised in such a funding environment for the fintech sector globally is a testament to both the Zest model and the market opportunity,\" the statement said.  During an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Lizzie Chapman, cofounder of ZestMoney said that the existing investors will pump funds into the business.  \"The investors, as I said, have been mostly working on this idea for an internal round and working on getting alignment among all the investors,\" Chapman said.  The firm did not disclose the funding size, however, sources told Moneycontrol that it was between $5 million and $10 million.  &amp;nbsp;  In Macrch, Walmart-backed PhonePe called off its deal with ZestMoney over due diligence concerns that led to a huge setback for the BNPL platform.  According to media reports, PhonePe would have paid $200-300 million to ZestMoney if the deal had gone through, much less than BNPL firm's last valuation of $470 million.  ZestMoney had been looking for a buyer for at least a year now as it has struggled to raise funds, according to multiple sources. The unsuccessful deal coupled with RBI's stringent regulations on BNPL businesses led to financial troubles within ZestMoney.  Founded in 2016 by Lizzie Chapman, Priya Sharma and Ashish Anantharaman, ZestMoney has a customer base of 17 million and enables loan disbursals of Rs 400 crore per month. The company has 27 lending partners and merchant partnerships with 10,000 online brands and 75,000 offline stores.  In May of 2023, all the founders of ZestMoney resigned and a new leadership team was formed with Abhishek Sharma as the head of growth, Mandar Satupte as chief banking officer, and Mohit Chhajer as the vice-president of finance and financial operations (FinOps).  \"This capital-combined with the unwavering commitment of our more than 150-strong team-enables us to successfully serve our consumers, merchants, and lender partners, while continuing to keep non-payment rates at under 2.5 percent in the largest and fastest-growing EMI market globally,\" said Sharma, ZestMoney's newly appointed CEO.  ZestMoney had in September 2022 raised $50 million from Australian BNPL fintech Zip Co. This is a part of a larger Series C fundraise which will see participation from existing investors like Goldman Sachs, Quona Capital, Xiaomi and Alteria Capital.\n",

Moreover, competition intensified amidst the lower raw material prices. However, the management has guided volume recovery in FY24 on account of rural expansion, increase grammage, and price cuts. EBITDA margins are likely to remain at the current level and the management does not expect meaningful recovery owing to price cuts along with higher ad-spends and increased start-up costs on account of continued capacity expansion in the company's existing plants (Ranjangaon &ndash; Dairy expansion, Bihar and Orissa) &bull; Though Q1FY24 results were below our estimates, we believe the worst is behind for the company as 1) Raw material prices of palm and packaging costs are in a downward trajectory (though they are still firm for wheat and sugar prices), 2) Ruralled distribution expansion and focused approached in Hindi belt region is expected to help the company gain market share, and 3) Rural revival is expected in the coming quarters, supporting recovery. Moreover, BRIT's long-term prospects remain strong as the management has a proven execution track record, robust portfolio planning through NPD in core and adjacencies, and a focus on continued distribution expansion in direct as well as rural markets.

We believe strong growth witnessed in corn hybrid seeds was largely led by better corn acreages in the ongoing kharif season (up 1% YoY as on 4th August'23) supported by remunerative corn prices (up 8% YoY to Rs2,295/quintal as on July'23). Pricing pressure in Round-up (Glyphosate) coupled with high cost inventory provisions in CP segment likely to have dent gross margins (down 580bps YoY) to 42.7%.

      "Rupee opens marginally lower against dollar\n",
      "The Indian rupee opened a tad weaker against the US dollar on August 8, tracking losses in its Asian peers. At 9.10 am, the home currency was trading at 82.80 to a dollar, down 0.06 percent from its previous close.  Traders turn cautious as the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy committee begins its meeting, the outcome of which will be shared on August 10. They also await July's CPI inflation data and industrial and manufacturing production data for June, which will be released on August 11.  \"With domestic fundamentals remaining robust, the rupee is likely to face tough resistance around the 82.80-83.00 zone and the upcoming sessions could see the pair falling back below the 82.50 territory. Hence, we suggest exporters not get complacent and importers not panic as overall biases of the USDINR pair remain on the downside,\" CR Forex said in a note.  Globally, attention would shift to inflation data emanating from the world's two largest economies, the US and China. The US Producer Price Index (PPI), too, would be watched closely.  Asian currencies traded weak as the dollar gained ahead of a crucial US CPI data to be released on August 10. The Japanese yen fell 0.54 percent, the South Korean won 0.5 percent, while the Philippine peso, the Malaysian ringgit and the Thai Baht declined 0.3 percent each.

      "The rupee ended marginally higher after falling for the fourth straight session with the dollar losing its charm after mixed US jobs data on Friday.  The Indian currency ended at 82.75 to a dollar, up 0.11 percent from its previous close of 82.84. The rupee opened at 82.72 to a dollar.  The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy meeting is scheduled from August 8-10. Additionally, the CPI inflation for July, industrial production, and manufacturing production data for June will be released on August 11.  Globally, during this week, the market's attention has shifted towards inflation data emanating from the world's two largest economies, namely the US and China. Subsequently, all eyes will be on the US Producer Price Index (PPI) as well.  \"Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) flows and the RBI's persistent pressure on the USD may shape the currency's performance, making it less likely for the rupee to depreciate beyond the 82.80-90 range. The prevailing sentiment suggests a potential move towards the 82.20-82.00 mark, indicating a degree of stability in the currency's outlook. In this context, exporters are advised to capitalise on any potential upticks in the dollar-rupee and explore selling opportunities, while importers are encouraged to exercise caution and wait for suitable hedging options,\" said Amit Pabri of CR Forex in a note to investors.

      "Rupee sinks to a month's low against the dollar in the opening trade\n",
      "The Indian rupee dropped to one-month low against the US dollar in the opening trade on August 2 amid rising crude prices and weak Asian currencies. A growing dollar demand and concerns over foreign outflows amid volatile local equities added to the weakness.  Global markets fell as negative sentiment after credit rating agency Fitch Ratings downgraded the US credit rating from AAA to AA+. This decision was driven by concerns over the anticipated fiscal deterioration in the US economy over the next three years.  At 11.07 am, the rupee was trading at 82.48 a dollar, down 0.16 percent from its previous close. The currency hit a low of 82.49 -- a level last seen on 10 July.  Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on August 2, trading near their highest since April after industry data showed a steeper-than-expected draw last week in oil inventories in the US, the world's biggest fuel consumer, news agency Reuters reported.  Foreign investors have sold shares worth Rs 5,700 crore over the past four sessions.  \"(The rupee weakened) due to rising dollar demand as concerns start to brew over the possibility of potential outflows of Russian funds held in rupees with local banks,\" CR Forex said in its latest note.  Amid the Western sanctions that restrict Russia from using the US dollar for trade, India paid in other currencies, including the dirham, yuan, and rupee, which local banks hold in special accounts, it said.  However, since Indian imports exceeded exports, Russian companies accumulated billions of rupees that the RBI has allowed to be invested in local government bonds. \"Well, the markets have been worried about the eventual outflows of these funds which could lead to a rise in FX volatility\", the report added.  Asian currencies were trading weak against the dollar as well. The South Korean won fell 0.84 percent, the Malaysian ringgit 0.46 percent, the Indonesian rupiah 0.34 percent, the Philippines peso 0.31 percent, the Taiwan dollar 0.22 percent, the Thai Baht 0.22 percent, while China Offshore lost 0.08 percent.

Crude oil prices jumped again after Chinese manufacturing PMI data released on Monday was lower than expected and increased chances of Chinese stimulus. Supply cuts from the OPEC+ nations and hopes of increased global oil demands are also supporting crude oil prices.  \"The important factor for us is Brent oil rising to $ 85.15 per barrel on tightening supplies, thus giving our CAD a rise in the coming months as the price of Russian oil rises too.

Sensex and Nifty lost around 2 percent in the last six trading sessions.  On Friday, the latest US economic data revealed a continued cooling of inflation alongside an increase in consumer spending. However, the Employment Cost Index (Q2) grew at a rate of 1 percent, falling short of the projected 1.10 percent and marking its lowest reading since September 2021. Meanwhile, the personal consumption expenditures price index saw a rise of 0.2 percent. These indicators suggest potential implications for the state of the US economy and may influence future economic policies.  Last week, both the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) made expected 25 basis points (bps) interest rate hikes. However, it was the Bank of Japan (BoJ) that surprised markets with its actions.

A note from advisory CR Forex read, \"The Indian Rupee is likely to face the heat of global risk-aversion could open lower around 82.25-30 levels, tracking broader strength in the DXY. Yesterday, the Rupee did not benefit despite a weaker dollar globally on the back of defense-related payment outflow, and the routine month-end dollar demand was also observed. However, the RBI might intervene in the spot market by selling dollars to curb unprecedented depreciation beyond the 82.50 to 82.70 zone.\"  The recent release of upbeat U.S. economic data supported the dollar index, as a possibility of further interest rate hike by the U.S. Fed in the September policy meeting has increased, analysts said. The crude oil, which was trading above $80 a barrel also dampened sentiments among traders.  Overnight, as expected, the European Central Bank (ECB) hiked the interest rate by 25 bps, thus bringing the deposit rate to 3.75 percent. ECB's President Ms Lagarde was somewhat dovish in her statements as she acknowledged that the European economic situation was deteriorating and there will be two inflation readings between now and September to assess the situation so far as the next meeting in September is concerned.

The post-meeting statement saw a notable change in the description of economic growth, which was upgraded from \"modest\" to \"moderate\" starting June. The statement indicated a bias towards \"additional policy firming\".  Despite the overall hawkish tone of the statement, chairman Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference leaned slightly towards the dovish side.  While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not committed to taking further actions, Powell said he observed encouraging signs in both the labour market and inflation rates.

In a note to investors, Emkay Research said, \"The ECB is poised to also raise the policy rate 25bp (basis point) and deliver relatively hawkish guidance at today's meeting.\"  The European Central Bank will opt for a hike again in September but slowing growth and core inflation would warrant a pause next quarter, it said.

      "What Benjamin Franklin Learned While Fighting Counterfeiters\n",
      "When Benjamin Franklin moved to Philadelphia in 1723, he got to witness the beginning of a risky new experiment: Pennsylvania had just begun printing words on paper and calling it money.  The first American paper money had hit the market in 1690. Metal coins never stayed in the 13 colonies long, flowing in a ceaseless stream to England and elsewhere, as payment for imported goods. Several colonies began printing bits of paper to stand in for coins, stating that within a certain time period, they could be used locally as currency. The system worked, but haltingly, the colonies soon discovered. Print too many bills, and the money became worthless. And counterfeiters often found the bills easy to copy, devaluing the real stuff with a flood of fakes.  Franklin, who started his career as a printer, was an inveterate inventor who would also create the lightning rod and bifocals, found paper money fascinating. In 1731, he won the contract to print 40,000 pounds for the colony of Pennsylvania, and he applied his penchant for innovation to currency.  During his printing career, Franklin produced a stream of baroque, often beautiful money. He created a copper plate of a sage leaf to print on money to foil counterfeiters: The intricate pattern of veins could not easily be imitated. He influenced a number of other printers and experimented with producing new paper and concocting inks.  Now, in a study published earlier this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of physicists has revealed new details about the composition of the ink and paper that Franklin used, raising questions about which of his innovations were intended as defenses against counterfeiting and which were simply experiments with new printing techniques.  The study draws on more than 600 artifacts held by the University of Notre Dame, said Khachatur Manukyan, a physicist at that institution and an author of the new paper. He and his colleagues looked at 18th century American currency using Raman spectroscopy, which uses a laser beam to identify specific substances - such as silicon or lead - based on their vibration. They also used a variety of microscopy techniques to examine the paper on which the money was printed.  Some of what they observed confirms what historians have long known: Franklin's paper money contains flecks of mica, also known as muscovite or isinglass. These shiny patches were most likely an attempt to combat counterfeiters, who would not have had access to this special paper, said Jessica Linker, a professor of American history at Northeastern University who studies paper money of this era and was not involved in the study. Of course, that didn't stop them from trying.  \"They come up with very good counterfeits, with mica pasted to the surface,\" Linker said.  In the new study, the researchers found that the mica in bills for different colonies seems to have come from the same geological source, suggesting that a single mill produced the paper. The Philadelphia area is notable for its schist, a flaky mineral that contains mica; it's possible that Franklin or printers and papermakers associated with him collected the substance used in their paper locally, Manukyan said.  When they examined the black ink on some of the bills, however, the scientists were surprised to find that it appeared to contain graphite. For most printing jobs, Franklin tended to use black ink made from burned vegetable oils, known as lampblack, said James Green, librarian emeritus of the Library Company of Philadelphia. Graphite would have been hard to find, he suspects.  \"So Franklin's use of graphite in money printing is very surprising, and his use on bills printed as early as 1734 is even more surprising,\" Green said in an email.  Could using graphite ink have been a way to differentiate real money from fakes? Differences in color between graphite and lampblack are likely to have been subtle enough to make that a difficult task, Green said. Instead, we may be looking at another example of Franklin's creativity.  \"It suggests to me that almost from the start, he was using his money printing contracts as an opportunity to experiment with an array of new printing techniques,\" he said.  To understand more clearly Franklin's intent, more analyses of printed documents from the era would be helpful, said Joseph Adelman, a professor of history at Framingham State University in Massachusetts.  \"The comparison I would most like to see would be Franklin's other publications,\" Adelman said. \"To really test this theory - does Franklin have this separate store of ink?\"  In future research, Manukyan hopes to collaborate with scholars who have access to larger collections of early American paper money. These techniques can be quite valuable in the study of history, Linker said, if scientists and historians can work together to identify the best questions to answer.  \"I have questions about a whole bunch of inks. There's a really weird green on some of the New Jersey bills,\" she said, referring to money printed by a Franklin contemporary. \"I would love to know what that green ink was made of.\"  (Author: Veronique Greenwood)/(c.2021 The New York Times Company)\n",

      "Internationalising INR: Local currency swap deals with trade partners can provide a boost\n",
      "No matter how well articulated the logic is, central bankers always have a tinge of conservativeness; the recently released Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) report of RBI on the internationalisation of the Indian rupee (INR) is no exception. The developments in the currency front cannot be studied in isolation, these are interlinked with the progress of the external sector and the composition of GDP growth. Over the last three decades not only our trade linkages with the world have increased, funds flow has gone up too. On the currency front, there are mixed signals, as a reserve currency the dominance of US dollars is on the wane. Yet, the dollar's share in foreign exchange turnover as indicated by Bank for International Settlement (BIS) Triennial Central Bank Survey was 88 percent in 2022. There are clear signs that in a multipolar world, other countries have a role to play too. Dealing With Financial Flows Internationalisation of the INR at the initial stage has to focus on denominating and settling cross-border trade and financial transactions in rupees. At this stage, it is useful to note that trade presents one part of the story; to complete the story one has to take into consideration the burgeoning financial flows. Current account convertibility would allow us to handle the trade issues. However, these days many of the transactions are purely financial dealings, which are not connected to trade. As the complexity of financial flows increases, the issue of capital account convertibility would require more attention. Internationalisation of currencies of emerging countries like that of India and China has three components, firstly, there has to be invoicing in domestic currency along with trade and settlement. Secondly, there is a need to focus on capital account convertibility and thirdly, one can explore the scope of entry to special drawing rights (SDR) basket. This can allow the currency to become a part of the reserve currency of other countries' central banks. The third objective is a long-term one. Boost From Trade The increasing acceptability of a currency is also closely linked to the home country's progress in international trade. The growing demand for yuan internationally is closely linked to the growth of China's manufacturing exports. For India too, exports of goods and services can play an important role, particularly in the context of bilateral and multilateral trade arrangements in local currency. Acceptance of the INR as settlement currency by the Asian Clearing Union is indeed welcome. China's experience in this area is noteworthy, between 2009 and 2020 China opened swap lines with 41 countries. The total amount exceeded RMB 3.5 trillion which was equivalent to $554 billion. They have a similar swap line with Russia which is more than $600 billion. The primary purpose is to enhance investment and trade with bilateral partners and reduce their dependence on the dollar and increase the acceptance of the yuan. These countries include South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. In a similar manner, local currency swap arrangements would provide liquidity to our trading partners for the purchase of Indian goods and services. There is also a need to further liberalise Indian government securities, corporate and sovereign bond markets for countries like the United Arab Emirates and Russia. The sudden fillip for the rupee trade in 2022 and 2023 came from the Russian offer of discounted crude on account of sanctions. The trade deficit with Russia is now $36 billion. The question to ask is if these discounts disappear due to the withdrawal of discounted crude offers or some other reason, then what will happen to the rupee trade? In other words, the rupee trade cannot be an outlier. We need to have a clear strategy for enhancing rupee trade with a number of countries including our neighbours. Interestingly, neither India nor China has capital account convertibility, considered a precondition for the internationalisation of a currency. It is even more amazing that the yuan has become a reserve currency though not a safe haven currency without capital account convertibility. Often, we tend to forget that many countries with open capital accounts play very limited roles in international finance. Some examples are Guyana, Jamaica, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago. Relatively poorer developing economies often have an open capital account for attracting capital. Incidentally, Indonesia too has an open capital account, it is a by-product of the capital shortage days. In other words, capital account convertibility is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the success of a country's currency internationalisation process. Further, many policymakers believe that floating currency goes hand-in-hand with an open capital account, this too is not a necessary condition. Hong Kong has an open capital account but its currency is pegged to the US dollar. When US interest rates started going up, capital outflows forced Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate to move up, this in its turn had the stock market in a squeeze. All these have some lessons for India - there is no tearing hurry for capital account convertibility. The establishment of domestic macroeconomic stability conditions should precede capital account convertibility. Siddhartha Roy is the former Economic Advisor of the Tata Group.

According to the agriculture ministry, the soybean acreage so far this season is 12.4 mln ha. In Madhya Pradesh, the largest producer of the oilseed in the country, soybean acreage is at 5.3 mln ha. Acreage in the second-largest grower, Maharashtra, is at 4.8 mln ha, data provided by SOPA showed. Since Jun 1, the country has received 528.9 mm of rainfall so far, against the normal of 526.9 mm, data from the India Meteorological Department showed. The government has pegged total oilseed output in 2022-23 (Nov-Oct) at 41.0 mln tn, against 38.0 mln tn the previous year. Soybean is a crucial kharif oilseed crop and accounts for around 30% of India's oilseed basket. The government has deferred the implementation of Cotton Bales (Quality Control) Order, 2023 to Nov 27 from Sep 1, according to a gazette notification. According to a notification issued on Feb 28, the new norm will require cotton bales to comply with the quality control order of the Bureau of Indian Standards. Earlier, the Cotton Association of India and the Tamilnadu Spinning Mills Association had written to the government to defer the implementation of a quality control order that was supposed to come into effect from Sep 1. The associations have said domestic ginners do not have adequate infrastructure to test 5% of cotton bales, as per the quality control order. Natural moisture in the lint during rainy season is about 10-12% and 15- 25% in Kapas, which is not in the hands of ginners to control moisture in the lint cotton to 8%. The associations said that even the same crop, grown at the same location and in the same environment, may not have the same quality and the same specifications.

      "Oil prices fall as China woes offset boost from high US fuel demand\n",
      "Oil prices fell in early Asian trade on Thursday after reaching fresh highs in the previous session as concerns about the Chinese economy offset the positive impact of steep drawdowns in U.S. fuel stockpiles and Saudi and Russian output cuts.  Brent crude fell 20 cents, or 0.2%, to $87.35 a barrel by 0006 GMT, after settling at its highest since Jan. 27 in the previous session.  West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 23 cents, or 0.3%, to $84.17, after settling at its highest since November 2022.  Chinese data on Tuesday showed crude oil imports in July fell 18.8% from the previous month to their lowest daily rate since January.  China's consumer sector also fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand.  However, prices were supported by government data on Wednesday that showed that U.S. gasoline stocks fell by 2.7 million barrels last week, while distillate inventories, which include diesel and heating oil, dropped by 1.7 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for both to hold mostly steady. [EIA/S]  Also supporting prices were top exporter Saudi Arabia's plans to extend its voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels per day for another month to include September. Russia also said it would cut oil exports by 300,000 bpd in September.  Investors were also awaiting July's U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), due on Thursday, which is expected to show a slight year-over-year acceleration.\n",

      "Downgrades outpace upgrades over the past month as Q1 earnings throw up nasty surprises\n",
      "On the face of it, first quarter earnings have given the street more cause for cheer than for lament, but a closer reading shows a different picture.  According to the data from Moneycontrol's July analyst call tracker, several companies have seen significant downgrades by brokerages over the past month following the release of their first-quarter earnings.  Infosys has secured the top position with 18 buy calls, 15 holds, and 12 sells, reflecting a shift from the previous month's figures of 29 buy calls, 9 holds, and 8 sells. Following suit, Power Grid Corp Of India and Hindustan Unilever Ltd received ratings of 14 buy, 5 hold, and 3 sells, and 29 buy, 13 hold, and 3 sells, respectively. A month ago, these two companies had 18 buy, 4 holds, and zero sells, and 36 buys, 7 holds, and 2 sells, respectively. All these three stocks have fallen over 5-6 percent each in the last one month.    According to analysts, Infosys is projected to face continued stock pressure for the next two quarters. The company has revised its revenue guidance twice in a span of three months due to weakened demand. The recent wave of high-level managerial resignations has further complicated the situation. In a soft-demand environment, Infosys might be losing market share, as indicated by its subdued growth guidance for 2023-24. The series of senior-level departures in recent quarters raises concerns about the company's stability and its effectiveness in managing key verticals, contributing to the stock's ongoing underperformance, according to a recent Jefferies report.  Power Grid has recently disclosed its financial results for the quarter ending June 2023, indicating a modest 1 percent uptick in revenue. This growth was hindered by factors such as the adverse influence of tariff differentials, sluggish expansion in asset capitalisation, and a significant 46 percent YoY decline in revenue from the consultancy segment. Nonetheless, the consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) demonstrated enhancement due to improved efficiencies. On a consolidated basis, there was a slight 5 percent decline in net profit compared to the previous year, primarily attributed to a notable decrease in the profit of the consultancy segment and a nearly 20 percent reduction in other income.  HUL's earnings for the June quarter were weaker than expected. Although there has been some improvement in gross margin buildup compared to analysts' expectations, the acceleration in volume is taking longer than anticipated due to the gradual normalisation of consumer habits, JM Financial said in its recent note. The management foresees this adjustment lasting for a span of two to three quarters. Despite the company's optimism regarding rural demand recovery, increased weather-related risks have become more prominent. Notably, heightened competitive pressures have emerged, fuelled by the assertiveness of smaller players in specific categories and an elevated intensity in media competition, the JM Financial report added.  \"In FY24E, the projected outlook entails single-digit sales growth centered on volume expansion. Although the company targets substantial gross margin enhancement, this progress could be counterbalanced by the need to raise Advertising &amp;amp; Promotion (A&amp;amp;P) spending, which has declined by over 350 basis points over the last three years. While the potential for a double-digit return from the stock is recognized for the upcoming year, the valuation multiples might be constrained due to the tougher operational landscape,\" according to the JM Financial report.  UPL Ltd, Tinan Co Ltd, and Ultratech Cement Ltd saw huge downgrades as well. As per Moneycontrol's analyst call tracker, UPL received 21 buy calls, 6 holds, and 2 sell calls, compared to the previous 25 buy calls and 2 each of hold and sell calls a month ago. Titan garnered 23 buy calls, 8 holds, and 4 sells, whereas it had previously secured 27 buy calls, 5 holds, and 3 sell ratings. Similarly, Ultratech Cement received 33 buy calls, 9 holds, and 4 sells, versus the earlier 37 buy calls and 4 each of hold and sell calls.  In the June quarter, UPL Ltd encountered substantial setbacks in both its profits and revenue, mainly due to a nearly double-digit decrease in sales volume. The company responded to aggressive pricing from Chinese sellers by implementing significant price reductions in international markets, according to a Motilal Oswal report. Amid the industry's slowdown, UPL expressed its intent to prioritise profitability and cash conservation. It also anticipates a reduction in working capital days in the future. Confronting formidable global challenges during April-June, UPL has revised its revenue and operating profit guidance for the fiscal year 2023-24 (April-March). The adjustment is notable, with projected revenue growth now ranging from 1 percent to 5 percent, compared to the earlier estimate of 6 percent-10 percent. Furthermore, EBITDA is forecasted to increase by 3 percent to 7 percent, in contrast to the previously expected rise of 8 percent-12 percent.  Ultratech Cement's earnings slightly missed estimates. As per a UBS report, there are concerns among industry observers about an anticipated demand slowdown post the upcoming general elections in May 2024. This is compounded by a swift surge in new capacity that could surpass medium-term demand. The industry is expected to witness around 110 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of new capacity entering the market within the next 2.5 years, in contrast to an incremental demand of 70mtpa. UBS forecasts that cement players might adopt aggressive pricing strategies to safeguard their market share, especially with the intensifying competition due to Adani group's entry into the sector.\n",

      "Gold Rate Today: Prices at 4-week low amid strong dollar, rate hike concerns\n",
      "Gold and silver prices hit a four-week low as the US dollar held on to its strength and investors remained concerned about a potential interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. This has led to cautious sentiment among investors, prompting a shift away from precious metals.  Adding to the downward pressure on precious metals is the continuous decline in global Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) holdings. In July, ETF holdings saw a significant reduction of 34 tonnes, marking the fourth consecutive month of liquidation. The year-to-date figures for 2023 saw a total reduction of 84 tons in ETF holdings.  Market participants are now closely watching for comments from US officials, particularly related to US CPI, set to be released on August 10.  In an environment of heightened uncertainty and evolving economic indicators, investors navigate a complex landscape as they assess the outlook for precious metals and their potential role in diversified portfolios.  Latest Gold Prices:  The latest Mumbai Gold Rate on August 9  is as follows:  The 24-carat 999 gold bar of 10 grams is trading at Rs 5,930. On the other hand, the 22-carat gold rate for a 10-gm piece of jewellery stands at Rs 5,670, while the rate for an 18-carat jewellery item is Rs 4,670.

      "Hindalco keeps brokerages upbeat with June quarter earnings\n",
      "Brokerages remained bullish on Hindalco Industries Ltd and raised its target price after its better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter.  Brokerage firm JM Financial has upheld its 'buy' rating on the stock and raised its target price by 21 percent to Rs 550 per share. The firm expressed that the stock continues to be its favourite within the metals space.  Motilal Oswal Securities maintained the 'buy' rating and increased its target price to Rs 550 a share, up 21 percent from current market price. Jefferies India upped the target price by 26 percent to Rs 575, while Antique stock broking raised its target price to Rs 526 and maintained the 'buy' rating.  Hindalco reported a 9 percent on-year decrease in consolidated revenue for the first quarter of FY24, amounting to Rs 53,000 crore. This surpassed analysts' expectations by 12 percent, as their estimate stood at Rs 47,500 crore. The company also experienced a 32 percent on-year drop in consolidated EBITDA, reaching Rs 5,700 crore, but this still exceeded analysts' projections by 10 percent, compared to their estimate of Rs 5,200 crore.  The company's net profit took a hit, declining by 40 percent to Rs 2,500 crore, yet it managed to surpass analysts' estimates by 22 percent, which were at Rs 2,000 crore. This improvement was primarily driven by increased other income, although it was somewhat offset by higher interest costs and tax expenditure.  The company has reported that the Chakla mine is progressing according to its established timeline and is anticipated to commence operations by FY26. Notably, the company has also achieved success in acquiring the Meenakshi West mine, which has the potential to yield approximately 6-7 million tonnes of coal annually. Looking ahead to FY24, the projected capital expenditure (capex) for both India operations and Novelis is estimated to be Rs 4,500 crore.  Analysts hold the belief that Hindalco will sustain its positive momentum due to several factors. These factors include the confidence in Novelis achieving its medium-term EBITDA-per-tonne target of $525 by the fourth quarter of FY24, the steadfast performance of Hindalco's aluminum operations in India, strengthened coal security resulting from the acquisition of the Meenakshi and Chakla coal mines, as well as the growth-focused capital expenditure aimed at expanding capacity in the downstream business segment.  Analysts hold the perspective that Hindalco exhibits a robust outlook for long-term opportunities. Their confidence is anchored in the company's leadership position in both the beverages can and automotive markets. This optimism is fuelled by the company's strong performance, driven by factors such as sturdy domestic demand, increased demand from electric vehicles and consumer durables sectors, elevated investments in infrastructure and construction, as well as heightened public and private sector capital expenditures.  As a result, Motilal Oswal Securities has raised their estimates for FY25 EBITDA and net profit by 4 percent and 10 percent, respectively.  According to Antique Stock Broking, enhanced performance in the copper segment, improved aluminum operations (driven by increased downstream volume from the new 34 KT Silvassa extrusion facility and an ongoing additional expansion of 350 KT through debottlenecking at the Utkal Alumina), reduced coal expenses, and progress in enhancing Novelis' operations are expected to contribute to an uplift in profitability.\n",

      "Agri Picks Report August 09, 2023: Geojit\n",
      "Geojit's report on Agri Picks India's 2023-24 (Jul-Jun) kharif acreage was steady at 91.5 mln ha as of Friday, according to data from department of agriculture and farmers welfare. Acreage of paddy, the key grain in kharif season, was up 3% on year at 28.3 mln ha. The paddy acreage has turned positive in the last couple of weeks as sowing picked up with the increase in rainfall across the country. Monsoon rains, important for sowing rice in non-irrigated areas, were 5% above long-period average as of Friday. Since Jun 1, the country has received 504.4 mm rainfall, 5% above the normal weighted average of 481.9 mm for the period. However, serious concerns remain as the key paddy growing regions of east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam and West Bengal have received deficient precipitation so far. The weather department has projected that rainfall will be normal to above normal in some parts of northeast India during Aug-Sep. Experts believe that untimely rainfall could damage the standing crops that have been planted in the region in the ongoing season. However, rice planting in eastern states of the country has not suffered much this season despite patchy monsoon rainfall and its uneven distrubution due to efficient irrigiation facilities in the region. The area under coarse cereals was at 16.4 mln ha, up from 16.2 mln ha a year ago, ministry data showed. Acreage under oilseeds was up 3% at 18.0 mln ha and area under pulses fell 9% to 10.7 mln ha. Last week, sowing of pulses was lagging by more than 11%. Pulses sowing has taken a hit this season as farmers across the country have been sowing other crops such as soybean in hope of better returns. Soybean acreage in the country is 4% higher on-year as of Friday, according to the data. &bull; Farmers in Telangana have sown paddy over 2.5 mln acres (1 acre = 0.40 ha) in the current kharif season, up to Wednesday, a hefty rise of 73% over the previous year's figure of 1.4 mln acres, according to official data. The total sown acreage in the state as of Wednesday was 8.3 mln acres, up 12% from 7.3 mln acres a year ago, but down 5% from the normal acreage of 8.7 mln acres. As of Wednesday, cotton, the major kharif crop in the state was sown across 4.3 mln acres down from 4.5 mln acres a year ago. The area under pulses fell 17% on year to 480,240 acres from 584,215 acres. Major pulses grown in the state are red gram, green gram, and black gram. The area under coarse grains, so far, was at 470,583 acres, up from 416,468 acres last year. The foodgrain acreage rose to 3.5 mln acres from 2.5 mln acres a year ago. The state reported 432,508 acres under oilseeds, higher than 354,128 acres last year. While soybean sowing rose 23% on year to 426,208 acres, groundnut fell 16% on year to 5,171 acres. Sugarcane sowing so far was at 15,773 acres, down from 22,773 acres last year, the state government data showed.

      "Oil edges up on higher US economic growth outlook; China import slump weighs\n",
      "Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as a U.S. government agency projected a rosier outlook on the economy, but bearish data on China's crude imports and exports weighed.  Brent crude futures gained 83 cents to settle at $86.17 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 98 cents to $82.92.  Both contracts had fallen by $2 earlier in the session, but prices reversed course after a monthly report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected gross domestic product growth to rise by 1.9% in 2023, up from 1.5% in a previous forecast. [EIA/M]  The EIA also expects Brent crude oil prices to average $86 in the second half of 2023, up about $7 from the previous forecast.  U.S. crude production is expected to rise by 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 12.76 million bpd in 2023, the report added, overtaking the last peak of 12.3 million bpd in 2019.  Crude prices have been rising since June, primarily because of extended voluntary cuts to Saudi Arabia's production as well as increasing global demand, the EIA said.  \"We expect these factors will continue to reduce global oil inventories and put upward pressure on oil prices in the coming months,\" the EIA added.  Weighing on prices on Tuesday, however, China's July oil imports were down 18.8% from the previous month to the lowest daily rate since January, but still up 17% from a year earlier.  Overall, China's imports contracted by 12.4% in July, far steeper than the expected 5% drop. Exports fell by 14.5%, compared with a fall of 12.5% tipped by economists.  Despite the gloomy data, some analysts were still positive on China's fuel demand outlook for August to early October.  The peak season for construction and manufacturing activity starts in September and gasoline consumption should benefit from summer travel demand, said CMC Markets analyst Leon Li. Demand is expected to decrease gradually after October, he added.  Last week's decision by Saudi Arabia to extend a voluntary output cut of 1 million bpd into September, despite Brent rising above $80, suggested Riyadh might be targeting a higher price than $80, said Vivek Dhar, mining and energy commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  Still, some analysts were sceptical about how much supply the cuts were actually taking off the market, as other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries such as Libya and Venezuela have increased production, said Andrew Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.  \"The production cuts have been far less than the announced quota cuts,\" Lipow said.  U.S. crude oil stocks rose last week, while gasoline and distillate stockpiles dropped, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. [API/S]  Crude stocks rose by about 4.1 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 4, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Gasoline inventories fell by about 400,000 barrels, while distillate inventories fell by about 2.1 million barrels.  U.S. government data on stockpiles is due on Wednesday.\n",

      "Gold Rate Today: Prices at 1-month low as US bond yields edge higher\n",
      "Gold prices witnessed a notable decline and hit a one-month low on the back of strength in US dollar and rising treasury yields, which exerted pressure on the precious metals market.  In such economic conditions, investors flock to alternative assets such as gold and silver, as a hedge against currency fluctuations.  The downward trend was further underscored by silver prices plummeting by 2 percent overnight and a staggering 5.5 percent over the week.  Moreover, US Federal Reserve official Bowman hinted at the likelihood of additional rate hikes in an effort to curb inflation, which added to the market sentiment and influenced the recent price movements in safe haven assets.  Investors now eagerly await inflation data from the US to be released on August 10, which is expected to provide more insights into the economic landscape.  Moreover, rising uncertainties globally, weak economic data and geopolitical tensions have further contributed to the downward pressure on precious metal prices.  Latest Prices:  The latest Mumbai Gold Rate on August 8 is as follows:  The 24-carat 999 gold bar of 10 grams is trading at Rs 5,938.

      "Oil falls as US rate hike fears subside, China demand weighs\n",
      "Oil prices fell slightly on Thursday, with Brent crude holding close to January highs, as speculation about another U.S. interest rate hike faded following inflation data and OPEC remained positive on the oil demand outlook.  Both benchmarks have been on a sustained rally since June, with WTI trading at its highest this year on Thursday and Brent hitting its highest price since January.  Brent crude fell 72 cents to $83.68 a barrel at 11:55 a.m. EDT (1555 GMT). West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) was down 46 cents at $87.09, after falling by $1 earlier in the session.  Oil prices have been boosted in recent days by extensions to output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, alongside supply fears driven by the potential for conflict between Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea region to threaten Russian oil shipments.  But recent data showed the consumer sector in China fell into deflation and factory gate prices extended declines in July, raising concerns about fuel demand in the world's second-largest economy.  The U.S. is also prohibiting some investment in China in sensitive technologies like computer chips and requires government notification in other tech sectors.  \"China's data just gets worse and worse, and this is only going to make it more difficult for China to ramp up its economy,\" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.  Lending support to prices, OPEC said in its monthly report on Thursday it expected a healthy oil market for the rest of the year, and stuck by its forecast for robust oil demand in 2024, as the outlook for world economic growth slightly improves.  Thursday's U.S. consumer prices data for July fuelled speculation the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its aggressive rate hike cycle.  Markets largely shrugged off a higher-than-expected 5.85 million-barrel build in U.S. crude stocks reported on Wednesday, after a record drawdown the week before.\n",

      "Average long-term US mortgage rate climbs to 6.96% this week, matching highest level this year\n",
      "The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate rose this week to just under 7%, the latest setback for would-be homebuyers already facing affordability challenges due to a housing market limited by a shortage of homes for sale.  Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on the benchmark 30-year home loan rose to 6.96% from 6.90% last week. A year ago, the rate averaged 5.22%.  It's the third consecutive weekly increase for the average rate, which now matches its high for the year set on July 13. High rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, limiting how much they can afford in a market already unaffordable to many Americans.  \"There is no doubt continued high rates will prolong affordability challenges longer than expected, particularly with home prices on the rise again,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. \"However, upward pressure on rates is the product of a resilient economy with low unemployment and strong wage growth, which historically has kept purchase demand solid.\"  The average rate on a 30-year mortgage remains more than double what it was two years ago, when it was just 2.87%. Those ultra-low rates spurred a wave of home sales and refinancing. The sharply higher rates now are contributing to a dearth of available homes, as homeowners who locked in those lower borrowing costs two years ago are now reluctant to sell and jump into a higher rate on a new property.  The lack of housing supply is also a big reason home sales are down 23% through the first half of this year.  The latest increase in rates follows an uptick in the 10-year Treasury yield, which climbed to 4.19% last week, it's highest level since early November. The yield, which lenders use to price rates on mortgages and other loans, was at 4.02% in midday trading Thursday.  High inflation drove the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022, lifting the fed funds rate to the highest level in 22 years. Inflation has come down steadily since last summer, and many analysts believe the Fed has reached the end of its rate hikes.  Mortgage rates don't necessarily mirror the Fed's rate increases, but tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Investors' expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Fed does with interest rates can influence rates on home loans.  The average rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with those refinancing their homes, rose to 6.34% from 6.25% last week. A year ago, it averaged 4.59%, Freddie Mac said.\n",

      "California agency to vote on San Francisco robotaxi expansion amid heavy opposition\n",
      "Amid strenuous pushback from San Francisco officials and many residents, a California state agency is set to vote on Thursday on a proposal to allow the city to be blanketed in self-driving taxis at all hours.  Approval would grant General Motors' Cruise and Alphabet Inc's Waymo the right to expand testing of their autonomous vehicles as paid taxis across the city, putting them in direct competition with ride-hailing providers Uber and Lyft.  The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which has statewide jurisdiction over autonomous vehicle regulation, drafted the proposal after Waymo and Cruise applied for permits that would allow for broader testing of the robotaxis.  The companies, which have ploughed billions into developing the vehicles, with little revenue, see the vote as a critical next step to broader regulation as they eye expanding into new cities and states.  But the vote at the meeting that begins at 11 a.m. PDT (1800 GMT) comes amid vigorous opposition from transportation and safety agencies in San Francisco.  They say the robot cars' sometimes unpredictable driving has interfered with fire officials, caused traffic jams and violated other rules of the road and that the companies fail to fully disclose data showing hiccups. They have sought a slower rollout.  Cruise and Waymo, in contrast, have asserted their robotaxis are safer than distractable human drivers, have not caused any deaths or life-threatening injuries over millions of collective miles driven and that real-world testing is critical to perfecting the technology.  Cruise said at a recent public hearing that it has about 300 vehicles in operation at night and 100 during the day, while Waymo said it has roughly 250. Both are expected to add to that number if the CPUC approves the proposal.  The measure has divided San Francisco between locals who resent their city being used as a testing lab for what they say is an unproven technology and those who say they feel the symbolic technology capital ought to be the leader in developing what could lead to fewer traffic accidents and injuries.  The CPUC has twice delayed the vote, in part because of the mounting opposition.  The CPUC on Tuesday heard testimony from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency that it had logged close to 600 incidents involving autonomous vehicles since the spring of 2022 and that they believe that is \"a fraction\" of the total due to what they say are lax reporting requirements.  Outfitted with spinning sensors, Waymo and Cruise vehicles are an arresting sight around San Francisco, particularly to visitors unaccustomed to cars with no human driver behind the wheel. Summoned by app, like ride-hailing trips, the vehicles are allowed to take passengers for free around much of the city, with some restrictions, and can only charge at night.\n",

      "US inflation rises for the first time in a year to 3.2% rate, but underlying measures remain mild\n",
      "Inflation in the United States rose in July after 12 straight months of declines, boosted by costlier housing. But excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation matched the smallest monthly increase in nearly two years. The inflation figure the government reported Thursday showed that consumer prices increased 3.2% from a year earlier. That was up from a 3% annual rise in June, which was the lowest rate in more than two years.  The July inflation figure remained far below last year's peak of 9.1%, though still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The Fed, economists and investors, though, pay particular attention to the core inflation figures for signs of where inflationary pressures might be headed. From June to July, core inflation remained a tame 0.2%. Thursday's price data will be among the key barometers the Fed will weigh in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates.  In its drive to tame inflation, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate 11 times since March 2022 to a 22-year high. A jump in energy prices has rekindled some of the inflation pressures underlying the economy. Gasoline prices have surged nearly 30 cents over the past month to a national average of $3.83 a gallon, according to AAA. Economists say that in the fight to conquer inflation, easy progress has likely already been achieved. Gasoline prices, for example, though liable to bounce around from month to month, have already plunged from a peak national average of more than $5 a gallon, which was reached in June of last year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Much of the inflationary surge that began in 2021 was caused by clogged supply chains: Ports, factories and freight yards were overwhelmed by the explosive economic rebound from the pandemic recession of 2020. The result was delays, parts shortages and higher prices. But supply-chain backlogs have eased in the past year, sharply reducing upward pressure on goods prices.  Prices of long-lasting manufactured goods actually dipped in June. Now, the Fed faces a daunting problem: persistent inflationary pressures in service businesses - restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues and the like - where wages represent a substantial share of costs. Worker shortages have led many of these services companies to sharply raise pay. Last week, for example, the Labor Department reported that average hourly wages rose 4.4% in July from a year earlier, more than expected.  To cover their higher labor costs, companies have typically raised their prices, thereby fueling inflation. Another factor working against continued declines in year-over-year inflation rates is that prices soared in the first half of last year before slowing in the second half. So any price increase in July would have the effect of boosting the year-over-year inflation rate. Still, economists caution against reading too much into one month of numbers.  Many of them expect inflation to continue trending lower. Used car prices, which had skyrocketed after the pandemic, have been edging down: They dropped 5.1% in July from a year earlier to $29,198, according to Edmunds.com. July of last year was near the peak of used-car price spikes, resulting from a scarcity of new vehicles caused by a global computer-chip shortage. Buyers who wanted new vehicles but couldn't find them entered the used market, sending used prices sharply higher.  This year, though, used vehicle prices began to drop once automakers managed to acquire more chips and could produce more new vehicles. Many shoppers who were forced to buy used are now back in the new-vehicle market. Used-vehicle prices are expected to decline, at least modestly, through the year. Despite chronic concerns about higher labor costs, one closely watched measure of wages and salaries - the Labor Department's employment cost index - grew more slowly from April through June.  Excluding government jobs, employee pay rose 1%, less than the 1.2% increase in the first three months of 2023. Compared with a year earlier, wages and salaries grew 4.6%, down from a year-over-year increase of 5.1% in the first quarter. Rents, which had soared after the pandemic, are also cooling. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote this week that \"year-over-year shelter inflation will continue to slow through late 2024 and may even turn negative by mid-2024.\"  Fed officials will have plenty of data to absorb before deciding whether to continue raising rates. Thursday's report is the first of two CPI numbers the policymakers will see before their next meeting on Sept. 19-20. In addition, their favoured inflation gauge, called the personal income expenditures price index, comes out on Aug. 31. And the August jobs report will be released on Sept. 1. Many economists and market analysts think the Fed's most recent rate hike in July will prove to be its last: Nearly 87% of traders expect no Fed hike next month, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n",

      "Number of Americans applying for jobless aid rises, but not enough to cause concern\n",
      "The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits jumped last week, but not enough to raise a concern about the consistently strong U.S. labor market.  U.S. applications for unemployment benefits rose by 21,000 to 248,000 for the week ending August 5, from 227,000 the week before, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That's the most in five weeks.  The four-week moving average of claims, a less volatile reading, ticked up by 2,750 to 228,250.  Jobless claim applications are viewed as broadly representative of the number of layoffs in a given week.  Applications for jobless aid reached a higher level above 260,000 for a few weeks this spring, causing some concern, but then retreated.  Troubling levels of inflation moved the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a breakneck pace for the past year-and-a-half: the central bank raised its benchmark rate 11 times to the current 5.4%, a 22-year high.  Part of the Fed's reasoning was to cool the job market and bring down wages, which, in theory, suppresses price growth. Though inflation has come down significantly during that stretch, the job market has remained remarkably strong.  Last week, the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added 187,000 jobs in July, fewer than expected, but still a healthy number. The unemployment rate dipped to 3.5%, close to a half-century low.  Also last week, the government reported that job openings fell below 9.6 million in June, the lowest in more than two years. However, the numbers remain unusually robust considering monthly job openings never topped 8 million before 2021.  Outside of a flurry of layoffs in the technology sector early this year, companies have mostly been retaining workers.  Many businesses struggled to replenish their workforces after cutting jobs during the pandemic, and much of the ongoing hiring likely reflects efforts by many firms to catch up to elevated levels of consumer demand that have emerged since the pandemic recession.  While the manufacturing, warehousing, and retail industries have slowed their hiring in recent months, they aren't yet cutting jobs in large numbers. Economists say that given the difficulties in finding workers during the past two years, businesses will likely hold onto them as long as possible, even if the economy weakens.  Overall, 1.68 million people were collecting unemployment benefits the week that ended July 29, about 8,000 fewer than the previous week.\n",

      "Investors Brace for Fallout From Ecuador Candidate's Killing\n",
      "Fernando Villavicencio, an anti-graft crusader and journalist, was murdered while leaving a political rally at school in the capital city of Quito late on Wednesday. Warring cocaine cartels have turned the once-peaceful country into one of the most violent places in the world, making law and order central to all candidates running in the upcoming elections.  As the nation reels, investors are looking for potential unrest, and trying to assess how the shocking events will impact voters ahead of the Aug. 20 election. Villavicencio was the second-most favoured candidate behind socialist Luisa Gonzalez, according to a poll released Wednesday. Conservative former sniper Jan Topic placed third, followed by Indigenous leader Yaku Perez and former vice president Otto Sonnenholzner.  \"This will favour the extremes,\" said Ramiro Blazquez, head of research and strategy at BancTrust.  The country's assets are already trading at distressed levels, after dollar bonds lost more than 25% this year, one of the worst performances in emerging markets globally. Losses accelerated after voters rejected referendum proposals and political opponents mounted an impeachment campaign against President Guillermo Lasso, prompting him to close Congress and triggering a snap vote.  Distressed Debt The selloff has left bonds due in 2035 and 2040, some of the nation's most liquid, trading at 30 to 35 cents on the dollar, levels they've been fairly steady at since March. The 2035 notes were quoted at 34.34 cents and the 2040s at 31.21 cents as of 9 a.m. in London on Thursday, according to indicative pricing on Bloomberg. Earlier on Wednesday, JPMorgan had recommended an overweight position on the nation's debt.  \"There has been relative social balance in Ecuador since Lasso used constitutional powers to dissolve the government and call for elections,\" said Oren Barack, managing director of fixed income at New York-based Alliance Global Partners. \"With very few details over the assassination, social unrest and protests are likely to occur over the coming days.\"  Ecuador has a checkered financial history. Since its independence, it has defaulted on its external debt 11 times, most recently at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. While the investment scenario improved under Lasso, with international reserves near record highs, minimal debt service payments and a narrowing fiscal deficit, the return of a hard left administration could upend the outlook for markets.  That possibility has likely diminished with Villavicencio's murder, according to Katrina Butt, senior economist for emerging markets at AllianceBernstein in New York.  \"It might provide more support in consolidation of the center-right candidate,\" she said, referring to Sonnenholzner. It could also benefit Topic's security-focused campaign but would be unlikely to provide a boost to the most leftist candidate, Perez, whose platform had little overlap with Villavicencio's.  Ecuador's election is one of a trio of Latin American votes this month in which crime and security are major issues. Argentina holds primaries on August 13 and Guatemala holds a runoff presidential vote on Aug. 20.\n",

      "WHO classifies 'Eris' Covid strain as 'variant of interest\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the EG.5 strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in different parts of the world, including India, as a \"variant of interest\" but said it did not seem to pose more of a threat to public health than other strains.  EG.5 or Eris variant of SARS-CoV-2 was first reported on February 17 this year, and designated as a variant under monitoring (VUM) on July 19. In its latest risk evaluation on Wednesday, the WHO designated EG.5 and its sub-lineages as a variant of interest (VOI). Variants are broadly categorised into three categories: (1) variants of interest (2) variants of concern and (3) variants of high consequence.  According to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), VOIs are defined as variants with specific genetic markers that have been associated with changes that may cause enhanced transmissibility or virulence, reduction in neutralisation by antibodies obtained through natural infection or vaccination. EG.5 is a descendent lineage of Omicron subvariant XBB.1.9.2. It carries an additional mutation in the spike protein, which the SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter and infect the human cells compared to the parent subvariant.  Within the EG.5 lineage, the subvariant EG.5.1 has an additional spike mutation and represents 88 per cent of the available sequences for EG.5 and its descendent lineages, the WHO said. As of August 7, 7,354 sequences of EG.5 have been submitted to GISAID, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, from 51 countries. The largest portion of EG.5 sequences are from China (30.6 per cent, 2,247 sequences).  The other countries with at least 100 sequences are the US, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia, Singapore, the UK, France, Portugal, and Spain. In India, only one case of EG.5 has been reported so far from Pune in May this year. Globally, there has been a steady increase in the proportion of EG.5 reported. During epidemiological week 29 (July 17 to 23, 2023), the global prevalence of EG.5 was 17.4 per cent, according to WHO.  Based on the available evidence, the public health risk posed by EG.5 is evaluated as low at the global level, aligning with the risk associated with XBB.1.16 and the other currently circulating VOIs. WHO in its risk evaluation report noted that while EG.5 has shown increased prevalence, growth advantage, and immune escape properties, there have been no reported changes in disease severity to date.  While concurrent increases in the proportion of EG.5 and COVID-19 hospitalisations (lower than previous waves) have been observed in countries such as Japan and Korea, no associations have been made between these hospitalisations and EG.5. However, due to its growth advantage and immune escape characteristics, EG.5 may cause a rise in case incidence and become dominant in some countries or even globally, according to the global health body.  WHO and its Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Evolution (TAG-VE) continue to recommend that countries prioritise specific actions to better address uncertainties relating to antibody escape and severity of EG.5. The global health authority has advised countries to share information on the growth advantage of EG.5 and provide sequence information.  It also urged the member countries to conduct neutralisation assays using human blood samples, representative of the affected communities, and EG.5 live virus isolates. The WHO and its Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) continue to regularly assess the impact of variants on the performance of COVID-19 vaccines to inform decisions on updates to vaccine composition.\n",

      "Heat, War and Trade Protections Raise Uncertainty for Food Prices\n",
      "As the rate of food price inflation eases in the United States and Europe, analysts are warning of a new era of volatility in global food prices, ushered in by a series of threats coming together in unprecedented ways.  A combination of calamities - extreme weather, Russia's targeting of grain supplies in Ukraine and some countries' growing willingness to erect protectionist barriers to food trade - has left food supplies more vulnerable and less prepared to absorb any one disruption, analysts say.  \"This is the new normal now, with more volatility and unpredictability, whether that's in commodity prices or food prices,\" said Dennis Voznesenski, a commodities analyst at Rabobank in Sydney, Australia.  Even without major disruptions, food prices can be variable, and many factors play into the price of a bushel of wheat or loaf of bread.  Last month, Russia pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal that had permitted Ukrainian farm exports by sea. The United Nations' food price index rose in July, interrupting its monthslong downward trend because of a jump in vegetable oil prices, driven in part by worries over shortages of Ukrainian sunflower seeds.  Droughts in India, Indonesia and other Asian food exporters have led to smaller harvests. Faced with consumers outraged over higher prices, governments have banned the export of critical foods, causing further disruptions. Since late June, the price of an Asian benchmark for rice has jumped 25%, according to the Thai Rice Exporters Association.  Other factors are pressuring prices on supermarket shelves, including higher labor costs as workers try to keep pace with inflation. And food producers are finding that in an environment of rising prices, they can lift them even higher to pad their profits.  Compared with early 2020, consumer food prices are up about 30% in Europe and 23% in the United States.  The disruptions have had a disproportionately negative impact on small farmers and people living in low-income countries, while leaving the world vulnerable to future upheaval. Last year, more than 700 million people faced hunger and 2.4 billion people lacked year-round access to sufficient and nutritious food, according to the United Nations.  \"The accumulation of the last shocks in the last few years have put countries in a very, very bad situation,\" said Maximo Torero, the chief economist of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. \"If another shock comes today, I honestly don't know how they're going to handle it.\"  Extreme Weather  This year, severe weather has been the main disrupter of food prices, said Hiral Patel, the head of sustainable and thematic research at Barclays in London.  Heat waves have broken records in China, wildfires have raged across southern Europe and North Africa, and July was the world's hottest month on record.  In Pakistan, where catastrophic floods in 2022 washed away much of the country's crops, the annual rate of food price inflation reached nearly 49% in May, according to the U.N. World Food Program.  Forecasters warn that the earth could be entering a multiyear period of exceptional warmth driven by greenhouses gas emissions and the return of El Ni&ntilde;o, a cyclical weather pattern.  \"There are increased chances of simultaneous crop losses in different parts of the world,\" Patel said.  The forecast for Europe's crop yields, including soft wheat and spring barley, was revised lower recently by the European Commission because of \"distinctly drier-than-usual conditions\" in large parts of the continent.  Curtailed food production in one region for one year usually does not matter much in a flexible and dynamic market, said Joseph Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. The issue arises when crops are knocked out for a few years running in multiple markets - for example, from droughts.  \"Those could create a lot more volatility going forward - it's one of the uncertainties about climate change,\" Glauber said. Persistent droughts \"could lead to regional shortfalls and, with poor countries unable to afford higher prices, food security issues.\"  War in Ukraine  Last month, when Russian President Vladimir Putin let the Black Sea grain deal expire and then his military attacked grain storage in Ukraine, the price of wheat rose, which in turn lifted prices of corn and soybeans. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, recently estimated that the end of the deal could lead grain prices to increase by 10-15 percent.  While that's a significant jump, it's smaller than the sudden surge in prices in the first weeks of the war.  That's because Ukrainian farmers are growing significantly less today. Ukraine also has increased its ability to export grain via rail and river, but these alternative routes cost more, said Voznesenski at Rabobank. And these routes aren't immune from attacks or severe weather, including drought.  \"You can't tell what Putin is going to do tomorrow,\" Voznesenski said. \"You can't tell when a government is going to put an export restriction in.\" An increase in food supply intervention by governments \"is going to create a lot more unpredictability,\" he added.  Trade Protectionism  Volatility in food prices has encouraged some governments to turn to restricting trade in order to keep precious stores of food closer to home.  Last month, India, the world's largest rice supplier, issued an export ban on non-basmati white rice. India had imposed a 20% export duty on that rice last year, but exports continued to rise because of geopolitical issues and extreme climate conditions in other countries, the Indian government said. On Friday, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported that rice prices in July were up nearly 20% from a year earlier, pushing its rice price index to the highest in 12 years.  India is not alone in taking such measures. Overall, the number of curbs or tax increases on food exports has jumped 62% since last year, according to the Global Trade Alert, a nonprofit based in Switzerland. Globally, 176 export curbs are in effect on food, feed or fertilizer.  Economists and trade experts have cautioned against these types of policies. Though they may shield local consumers from food inflation in the near term, they ultimately compound the types of global food shortages that governments are trying to mitigate.  In a recent food security summit hosted by the U.N. in Rome, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director general of the World Trade Organization, urged countries to reject protectionism and turn to more open trade as a way to address food shortages.  For many countries, the problem has been worsened by the weak value of their currencies in comparison with the U.S. dollar, which leaves them unable to buy as many dollar-denominated commodities as before.  Invisible Costs  As food producers are dealing with more supply risks, related expenses are also rising. Much of the cost of food we eat at home comes from transportation and other expenses faced by food companies - not just from the commodity cost of growing the wheat or sugar. And some of those nonagricultural costs are rising, too.  Companies are being forced to fork out money for insurance policies to deal with harsh weather and invest in new suppliers to make their business more resilient.  Persistent drought has lowered water levels on key shipping routes, including the Panama Canal and the Rhine River in Europe, requiring shippers to lighten their loads or find other routes.  And then there is the cost of sustainability efforts as countries seek to meet net-zero-emissions targets. In all, risks that food prices stay high or swing more wildly have grown.

      "औसत दीर्घकालिक यू. एस. इस सप्ताह बंधक दर बढ़कर 7% से कम हो गई है, जो भावी घर खरीदने वालों के लिए नवीनतम झटका है, जो बिक्री के लिए घरों की कमी से सीमित आवास बाजार के कारण पहले से ही किफायती चुनौतियों का सामना कर रहे हैं।. बंधक खरीदार फ्रेडी मैक ने गुरुवार को कहा कि बेंचमार्क 30-वर्षीय गृह ऋण पर औसत दर बढ़कर 6 हो गई है. 6 से 96%. पिछले सप्ताह 90%. एक साल पहले यह दर औसतन 5 थी. 22%. यह औसत दर में लगातार तीसरी साप्ताहिक वृद्धि है, जो अब 13 जुलाई को निर्धारित वर्ष के उच्चतम स्तर से मेल खाती है. उच्च दरें उधारकर्ताओं के लिए प्रति माह सैकड़ों डॉलर की लागत जोड़ सकती हैं, जिससे यह सीमित हो जाएगा कि वे उस बाजार में कितना खर्च कर सकते हैं जो पहले से ही कई अमेरिकियों के लिए अप्राप्य है।. फ्रेडी मैक के मुख्य अर्थशास्त्री सैम खातेर ने कहा, \"इसमें कोई संदेह नहीं है कि उच्च दरें जारी रहने से सामर्थ्य की चुनौतियां अपेक्षा से अधिक लंबी हो जाएंगी, खासकर घर की कीमतें फिर से बढ़ रही हैं।\". \"हालांकि, दरों पर ऊपर की ओर दबाव कम बेरोजगारी और मजबूत वेतन वृद्धि के साथ एक लचीली अर्थव्यवस्था का उत्पाद है, जिसने ऐतिहासिक रूप से खरीद मांग को ठोस बनाए रखा है. \"30-वर्षीय बंधक पर औसत दर दो साल पहले की तुलना में दोगुनी से अधिक बनी हुई है, जब यह केवल 2 थी. 87%. उन बेहद कम दरों ने घर की बिक्री और पुनर्वित्त की लहर को प्रेरित किया. तेजी से ऊंची दरें अब उपलब्ध घरों की कमी में योगदान दे रही हैं, क्योंकि घर के मालिक जिन्होंने दो साल पहले उधार लेने की लागत कम कर दी थी, अब बेचने के लिए अनिच्छुक हैं और नई संपत्ति पर ऊंची दर लगा रहे हैं।. आवास आपूर्ति की कमी भी एक बड़ा कारण है कि इस वर्ष की पहली छमाही में घरों की बिक्री 23% कम हो गई है. दरों में नवीनतम वृद्धि 10-वर्षीय ट्रेजरी उपज में बढ़ोतरी के बाद हुई है, जो बढ़कर 4 हो गई है. पिछले सप्ताह 19%, नवंबर की शुरुआत के बाद से यह उच्चतम स्तर है. उपज, जिसका उपयोग ऋणदाता बंधक और अन्य ऋणों पर मूल्य दरों के लिए करते हैं, 4 पर थी. गुरुवार दोपहर के कारोबार में 02%. उच्च मुद्रास्फीति ने फेडरल रिजर्व को मार्च 2022 के बाद से अपनी बेंचमार्क ब्याज दर को 11 बार बढ़ाने के लिए प्रेरित किया, जिससे फेड फंड दर 22 वर्षों में उच्चतम स्तर पर पहुंच गई।. पिछली गर्मियों से मुद्रास्फीति लगातार कम हुई है, और कई विश्लेषकों का मानना ​​है कि फेड अपनी दर वृद्धि के अंत तक पहुँच गया है. बंधक दरें आवश्यक रूप से फेड की दर में वृद्धि को प्रतिबिंबित नहीं करती हैं, लेकिन 10-वर्षीय ट्रेजरी नोट पर उपज को ट्रैक करती हैं. भविष्य की मुद्रास्फीति के लिए निवेशकों की उम्मीदें, यू.एस. की वैश्विक मांग. एस. राजकोष और फेड ब्याज दरों के साथ जो करता है वह गृह ऋण पर दरों को प्रभावित कर सकता है. अपने घरों को पुनर्वित्त करने वालों के बीच लोकप्रिय 15-वर्षीय निश्चित दर बंधक पर औसत दर बढ़कर 6 हो गई. 6 से 34%. पिछले सप्ताह 25%. एक साल पहले इसका औसत 4 था. 59%, फ्रेडी मैक ने कहा\n",
      "बैंकरों का कहना है कि आरबीआई के आई-सीआरआर से बैंकों के लिए तरलता की कोई कमी नहीं होगी\n",
      "बैंकरों ने 10 अगस्त को मनीकंट्रोल को बताया कि भारतीय रिज़र्व बैंक (RBI) की वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (I-CRR) की घोषणा से बैंकिंग उद्योग के लिए तरलता की कोई कमी पैदा होने की संभावना नहीं है, जो बदले में ऋण देने की प्रक्रिया में बाधा बन सकती है।. उन्होंने कहा कि बैंकरों को नीति-पश्चात् प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस के दौरान आरबीआई गवर्नर शक्तिकांत दास के आश्वासन से राहत मिल रही है कि केंद्रीय बैंक तरलता प्रबंधन के प्रति सक्रिय रहेगा और दोनों पक्षों पर कार्य करेगा।. \"ऋण के लिए तरलता की उपलब्धता है. यूको बैंक के प्रबंध निदेशक (एमडी) और मुख्य कार्यकारी अधिकारी (सीईओ) अश्विनी कुमार ने कहा, \"मुझे नहीं लगता कि इसका कोई प्रभाव पड़ेगा क्योंकि बैंकों के पास पर्याप्त तरलता उपलब्ध है।\". इससे पहले आज, केंद्रीय बैंक ने कहा कि अनुसूचित वाणिज्यिक बैंकों को 19 मई, 2023 और 28 जुलाई के बीच अपनी शुद्ध मांग और समय देनदारियों (एनडीटीएल) में वृद्धि पर 10 प्रतिशत का वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (आई-सीआरआर) बनाए रखना होगा। . बैंकिंग प्रणाली में 2,000 रुपये के नोटों की वापसी के बाद अर्थव्यवस्था में बढ़ी अधिशेष तरलता के प्रबंधन के उद्देश्य से इसकी घोषणा की गई थी।. 19 मई को, RBI ने 2,000 रुपये के नोट को वापस लेने की घोषणा की, जिससे नागरिकों को या तो नोट बदलने या अपने खातों में जमा करने की अनुमति मिल गई।. 1 अगस्त को केंद्रीय बैंक ने कहा कि 3 रु. 31 जुलाई तक 14 लाख करोड़ मूल्य के 2,000 रुपये के बैंकनोट या 88 प्रतिशत प्रचलन में थे, बैंकिंग प्रणाली में वापस आ गए थे।. हालांकि, कुछ बैंकर्स का कहना है कि अगर लिक्विडिटी कंट्रोल में नहीं रही तो आरबीआई इस अवधि को बढ़ा सकता है. \"हम इसे एक अस्थायी उपाय के रूप में देख रहे हैं, और हमें उम्मीद है कि यह वैसा ही रहेगा. यदि केंद्रीय बैंक द्वारा बताई गई निर्धारित अवधि में तरलता प्रणाली नियंत्रण में नहीं है, तो हम केंद्रीय बैंक से आई-सीआरआर लगाने की अवधि बढ़ाने की उम्मीद कर सकते हैं,'' कोटक महिंद्रा बैंक के ग्लोबल ट्रांजेक्शन बैंकिंग के अध्यक्ष शेखर भंडारी ने कहा।. कमाई के मोर्चे पर, कुमार ने कहा कि बैंक की कमाई पर बहुत कम प्रभाव पड़ेगा. अपने संबोधन में, गवर्नर दास ने इस बात पर प्रकाश डाला कि केंद्रीय बैंक ने वित्तीय और मूल्य स्थिरता के हित में आई-सीआरआर लगाने को वांछनीय माना है और बैंकों के पास अपने ऋण देने के संचालन के लिए पर्याप्त तरलता होगी।. \"तरलता की अधिकता की पृष्ठभूमि में वृद्धिशील सीआरआर को आवश्यक माना गया था. हमने इसे वित्तीय और मूल्य स्थिरता के हित में वांछनीय माना. इसका असर महंगाई पर भी पड़ेगा. दास ने कहा, ''यह पूरी तरह से अस्थायी उपाय है।''. दरों पर कोई असर नहीं आईडीबीआई बैंक के उप प्रबंध निदेशक सुरेश खटनहार ने कहा कि नीति की घोषणा के बाद बैंक अपनी जमा या उधार दरों में कोई बदलाव नहीं कर सकते हैं।. 10 अगस्त को, मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) ने सर्वसम्मति से रेपो दर को 6 पर अपरिवर्तित छोड़ने के लिए मतदान किया. 5 प्रतिशत, गवर्नर दास ने आज घोषणा की. स्थायी जमा सुविधा दर को भी 6 पर बरकरार रखा गया है. 25 प्रतिशत. साथ ही, सीमांत स्थायी सुविधा दर और बैंक दर दोनों को 6 पर बरकरार रखा गया है. 75 प्रतिशत. अश्विनी कुमार ने कहा, ''हम उम्मीद कर रहे थे कि रेपो रेट में ठहराव जारी रहेगा।''. मार्जिनल कॉस्ट ऑफ फंड्स-आधारित लेंडिंग रेट (एमसीएलआर) के नजरिए से ब्याज दरों में स्थिरता है. उन्होंने कहा, एक या दो बकेट के भीतर कुछ बैंड में ब्याज दरों में कुछ बढ़ोतरी देखी जा सकती है. आरबीआई ने चालू वित्त वर्ष में लगातार तीसरी बार ब्याज दरें अपरिवर्तित रखीं. यूपीआई लाइट की लेनदेन सीमा 200 रुपये से बढ़ाकर 500 रुपये करने के आरबीआई के फैसले पर बैंकरों ने कहा कि इस कदम से डिजिटलीकरण बढ़ेगा. सितंबर 2022 में नेशनल पेमेंट्स कॉरपोरेशन ऑफ इंडिया (एनपीसीआई) द्वारा लॉन्च किया गया, यूपीआई लाइट बैंकों के प्रसंस्करण संसाधनों को अनुकूलित करके त्वरित छोटे मूल्य के लेनदेन की अनुमति देता है, जिससे लेनदेन विफलताएं कम होती हैं।. यह उपयोगकर्ताओं को पिन कोड की आवश्यकता के बिना प्रतिदिन 200 रुपये तक का लेनदेन करने की अनुमति देता है, जिससे लेनदेन का समय कम हो गया है।. जबकि लेनदेन की सीमा अब 500 रुपये तक बढ़ा दी गई है, दो-कारक प्रमाणीकरण की छूट से जुड़े जोखिमों को रोकने के लिए यूपीआई लाइट बैलेंस सीमा को 2,000 रुपये पर अपरिवर्तित छोड़ दिया गया है।. यूपीआई लाइट पेटीएम पर उपलब्ध है.

      "भारतीय रिजर्व बैंक (RBI) ने 10 अगस्त को कहा कि अनुसूचित बैंकों को 19 मई से 28 जुलाई के बीच अपनी शुद्ध मांग और समय देनदारियों (NDTL) में वृद्धि पर 10 प्रतिशत का वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (I-CRR) बनाए रखना होगा।. केंद्रीय बैंक ने कहा कि मौजूदा नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (सीआरआर) 4 पर अपरिवर्तित रहेगा. 5 प्रतिशत. तो, यह I-CRR क्यों? . आई-सीआरआर और सीआरआर के बीच अंतर आई-सीआरआर सीआरआर के समान है, जिसमें बैंकों को अपने पैसे का एक निश्चित हिस्सा आरबीआई के पास अलग रखना पड़ता है।. इस पर उन्हें कोई ब्याज नहीं मिलता. इसी तरह, आई-सीआरआर के साथ, बैंकों को 19 मई से 28 जुलाई के बीच अर्जित एनडीटीएल का अतिरिक्त 10 प्रतिशत अलग रखना होगा।. RBI ने I-CRR की घोषणा क्यों की है? . आरबीआई गवर्नर शक्तिकांत दास ने मौद्रिक नीति समिति की बैठक के बाद प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में कहा, \"इस उपाय का उद्देश्य बैंकिंग प्रणाली में 2,000 रुपये के नोटों की वापसी सहित विभिन्न कारकों से उत्पन्न अधिशेष तरलता को अवशोषित करना है।\". पिछले कुछ महीनों में, 2,000 रुपये के बैंक नोटों की वापसी, आरबीआई के अधिशेष को सरकार को हस्तांतरित करने, सरकारी खर्च में बढ़ोतरी और पूंजी प्रवाह के बाद बैंकिंग प्रणाली में तरलता तेजी से बढ़ी है।. इसे कम करने के लिए, केंद्रीय बैंक ने अलग-अलग अवधि की विभिन्न परिवर्तनीय दर रिवर्स रेपो (वीआरआरआर) नीलामियां आयोजित की हैं, लेकिन बैंकों से धीमी प्रतिक्रिया मिली, क्योंकि उन्होंने सीमांत स्थायी सुविधा के तहत बाद में धन मांगने से बचने के लिए तरलता को बनाए रखना पसंद किया। . एमएसएफ बैंकों को आपात स्थिति में रेपो से अधिक दर पर आरबीआई से उधार लेने की अनुमति देता है. जून के बाद से, केंद्रीय बैंक ने 18 लाख करोड़ रुपये के लिए 16 वीआरआरआर नीलामी आयोजित की है. हालाँकि, बैंकों ने इन नीलामियों में केवल 7,73,023 करोड़ रुपये लगाए. I-CRR में कितना पैसा जमा होगा? . 11 लाख करोड़. एनएमआईएमएस सरला अनिल मोदी स्कूल ऑफ इकोनॉमिक्स की एसोसिएट प्रोफेसर ईशा खन्ना के अनुसार, इस कदम से अल्पावधि में तरलता की स्थिति थोड़ी सख्त हो सकती है और अल्पकालिक कॉल दरें प्रभावित हो सकती हैं।. इसका प्रणालीगत तरलता पर क्या प्रभाव पड़ेगा? . \"10 प्रतिशत का आईसीआरआर बैंकिंग प्रणाली से 1 लाख करोड़ रुपये से थोड़ा अधिक निकाल सकता है. इसके बावजूद, अगले 1-2 महीनों के लिए सिस्टम में तरलता 1 लाख करोड़ रुपये से अधिक अधिशेष में रहेगी, ”पंकज पाठक, फंड मैनेजर-फिक्स्ड इनकम, क्वांटम एएमसी ने कहा।. लेकिन आई-सीआरआर अल्पकालिक दरों को प्रभावित करेगा, जो 15-20 आधार अंक (बीपीएस) तक कठोर हो सकता है।. सह-समूह प्रमुख - वित्तीय, वरिष्ठ उपाध्यक्ष, अनिल गुप्ता ने कहा, \"हमें उम्मीद है कि निकट अवधि में ट्रेजरी बिल, कॉल मनी दरें और वाणिज्यिक पत्र जैसे मुद्रा बाजार उपकरणों की अल्पकालिक दरों में 15-20 बीपीएस की वृद्धि होगी।\" . क्या इसका उधार और जमा दरों पर असर पड़ेगा? . दास ने सम्मेलन के दौरान कहा, \"हम यह सुनिश्चित करेंगे कि बैंकों के लिए ऋण देना जारी रखने के लिए प्रणाली में पर्याप्त तरलता हो।\". क्या आरबीआई वीआरआरआर नीलामी जारी रखेगा? . दास ने कहा, \"वीआरआरआर (नीलामी) जारी रहेगी।\" उन्होंने कहा कि वीआरआरआर प्रणाली 10 अगस्त को लगभग 93,000 करोड़ रुपये जारी करेगी।\n",

      "इंजीनियरिंग पाठ्यक्रम, जिनकी एक समय भारत में छात्रों द्वारा अत्यधिक मांग थी, अब अपना आकर्षण खोते जा रहे हैं. देश में इंजीनियरिंग और प्रौद्योगिकी पाठ्यक्रमों में दाखिला लेने वाले छात्रों की संख्या में हाल के वर्षों में लगातार गिरावट देखी गई है, जो घटकर 39 रह गई है।. 2020-21 में 45 से बढ़कर 2 लाख. आधिकारिक आंकड़ों के मुताबिक, 2014-15 में 4 लाख. शिक्षा मंत्रालय द्वारा प्रकाशित उच्च शिक्षा पर अखिल भारतीय सर्वेक्षण (एआईएसएचई) का डेटा इस मामले पर पूछे गए एक प्रश्न के उत्तर में शिक्षा राज्य मंत्री सुभाष सरकार द्वारा संसद में साझा किया गया था।. अखिल भारतीय तकनीकी शिक्षा परिषद से मिली जानकारी का हवाला देते हुए उन्होंने कहा, \"2011-12 से 2020-21 तक नामांकन में मामूली गिरावट का कारण छात्रों की प्राथमिकताओं में बदलाव और वैकल्पिक नौकरी के अवसरों वाले नए पाठ्यक्रमों की शुरूआत हो सकती है।\" . एआईएसएचई के डेटा से पता चलता है कि स्नातक स्तर पर बैचलर ऑफ इंजीनियरिंग (बीई) और बैचलर ऑफ टेक्नोलॉजी (बीटेक) एकमात्र प्रमुख कार्यक्रम हैं जिनमें नामांकन में गिरावट देखी गई है।. जैसे-जैसे नामांकन की संख्या में गिरावट आई है, इंजीनियरिंग पाठ्यक्रम प्रदान करने वाले कॉलेजों की संख्या में भी कमी आई है, जिनमें से कई हाल के वर्षों में बंद हो गए हैं. एआईसीटीई द्वारा अनुमोदित तकनीकी और इंजीनियरिंग कॉलेजों की संख्या में 9 की गिरावट आई है. 2017-18 से 2023-24 के बीच 02 फीसदी. रोजगार की कमी इंडिया स्किल रिपोर्ट 2022 के आंकड़ों के अनुसार, भारत के लगभग आधे इंजीनियरिंग स्नातक रोजगार के योग्य नहीं हैं. 2022 में बीई या बीटेक पाठ्यक्रम पूरा करने वाली रोजगार योग्य प्रतिभा का प्रतिशत सिर्फ 55 प्रतिशत था. इस बीच, विश्व आर्थिक मंच (डब्ल्यूईएफ) के अनुमान से पता चलता है कि देश के पांच इंजीनियरिंग स्नातकों में से केवल एक ही रोजगार के योग्य है।. इसके अलावा, नीति आयोग के पूर्व उपाध्यक्ष राजीव कुमार के एक बयान के अनुसार, भारत के 48 प्रतिशत इंजीनियरिंग स्नातक बेरोजगार हैं।. उपयुक्त नौकरियों की कमी एस्पायरिंग माइंड्स (जिसे अब एसएचएल कहा जाता है) की एक रिपोर्ट से पता चलता है कि भारत में अधिकांश इंजीनियरिंग स्नातकों के लिए, आवेदन करने के लिए सही कंपनी या प्रोफ़ाइल ढूंढना रोजगार पाने में सबसे बड़ी चुनौती है, इसके बाद साक्षात्कार में सफल होना पड़ता है।. हालाँकि लगभग 95 प्रतिशत छात्रों ने अपनी रोजगार क्षमता में सुधार के लिए किसी न किसी प्रकार का प्रशिक्षण लिया है, लेकिन अधिकांश ने कॉलेज में ही ऐसा किया है. अधिक चिंताजनक बात यह है कि सर्वेक्षण में शामिल 59 प्रतिशत छात्रों ने कहा कि संकाय सदस्य उनसे पाठ्यक्रम में शामिल अवधारणाओं के उद्योग अनुप्रयोगों के बारे में बात नहीं करते हैं।. ऐसा लगता है कि आवेदन करने के लिए सही नौकरियां ढूंढने में कठिनाई आईआईटी जैसे प्रमुख संस्थानों तक भी बढ़ रही है. आईआईटी बॉम्बे में सेंटर फॉर पॉलिसी स्टडीज के एक अध्ययन के अनुसार, 2014 और 2018 के बीच, संस्थान से लगभग 60 प्रतिशत स्नातकों ने गैर-प्रमुख नौकरियां लीं, जो उनके अध्ययन की शाखा के अलावा अन्य क्षेत्रों में नौकरियों को संदर्भित करता है।. कंप्यूटर विज्ञान और इंजीनियरिंग तथा इलेक्ट्रिकल इंजीनियरिंग को छोड़कर सभी शाखाओं के अधिकांश छात्रों ने गैर-प्रमुख नौकरियों के लिए अधिक प्राथमिकता दिखाई\n",

      "कुछ अपवादों को छोड़कर, सबसे प्रमुख केंद्रीय बैंक ब्याज दरें किस दिशा में जा रही हैं, इसका विस्तृत अनुमान प्रदान करने के व्यवसाय से सेवानिवृत्त हो गए हैं. चिंताजनक मुद्रास्फीति के युग में गलत होने की कीमत बहुत अधिक थी. जापान कुछ नया करने की कोशिश कर रहा है: फॉरवर्ड मिसगाइडेंस. बैंक ऑफ जापान ने पिछले एक दशक में जो विकल्प चुने हैं उनमें बग की बजाय परेशान करने वाले आश्चर्य शामिल हैं. अति-लूज़ पैसे और इसका समर्थन करने वाले साजो-सामान को ख़त्म करने का मतलब है कि हाल ही में वैश्विक बाज़ारों को हिलाकर रख देने वाली संचार दुर्घटनाएँ अवश्य घटित होंगी।. यदि वे वास्तव में एक दुर्घटना थे. निवेशकों को कम आसान पैसे की राह पर अधिक रोमांच के लिए तैयार रहना चाहिए. मुद्रास्फीति अब ज़मीन से नीचे आ गई है - इस बारे में तर्क हैं कि कीमतों में कितनी गति है - वांछित गंतव्य संभवतः सरकारी बांडों पर पैदावार की जोरदार पुलिसिंग का अंत है. और संभवतः, नकारात्मक आधिकारिक दरों का अंत हो जाएगा. यह रातोरात नहीं होगा, लेकिन एक सम्मानजनक निकास की संभावनाएं लंबी हैं. बीओजे नीति में बदलावों के प्रति बाजार की संवेदनशीलता अत्यधिक है क्योंकि अधिकारी अपने दृष्टिकोण की दिशा में मार्गदर्शन करने के बजाय सीधे प्रतिभूतियों के मूल्य का प्रबंधन करना चाहते हैं।. कुछ बीओजे पर्यवेक्षकों ने भविष्यवाणी की कि गवर्नर काज़ुओ उएदा 27-28 जुलाई की बैठक के समापन पर दीर्घकालिक बाजार दरों में वृद्धि करेंगे. यूएडा ने जुलाई की शुरुआत में भारत के 20 वित्त मंत्रियों और केंद्रीय बैंकरों के समूह की बैठक में पुष्टि करते हुए नरम लहजे का इस्तेमाल किया था कि चीजें वैसी ही बनी रहेंगी. उन्होंने कहा, \"जब तक परिसर को स्थानांतरित नहीं किया जाता, पूरी कहानी अपरिवर्तित रहेगी।\". बैंक के अंदर की रिपोर्टें इस कथन का समर्थन करती प्रतीत हुईं; . वह 28 जुलाई की सुबह, टोक्यो समयानुसार, 2 बजे तक था, जब निक्केई अखबार में एक कहानी ने संकेत दिया कि 10-वर्षीय जापानी सरकारी ऋण पर दरों को 0 से ऊपर जाने की अनुमति दी जाएगी।. 5 प्रतिशत. उएदा के छोटे शासनकाल में यह दूसरी बार था कि जापानी मीडिया के पास सभा के अंदर की जानकारी थी. फिर भी, व्यापारियों के पास पूरी कहानी नहीं थी, रिपोर्ट में 1 प्रतिशत की सीमा का कोई उल्लेख नहीं था. जब अनंत प्रतीक्षा के बाद आधिकारिक घोषणा हुई - बीओजे ने अभी भी पहले से कोई समय नहीं दिया है कि नीति की घोषणा कब की जाएगी, जिससे डीलरों को स्क्रीन को ताज़ा करने में कोई फायदा नहीं हुआ - इसने 10 साल की उपज के लिए तीन अलग-अलग स्तरों के उल्लेख के साथ बाजार को भ्रमित कर दिया। . 5 प्रतिशत \"सीमा\" और 1 प्रतिशत \"सीमा\" जिस पर बैंक कदम उठाएगा). निवेशक अभी भी इस बात पर बहस कर रहे हैं कि इस कदम का क्या मतलब है. बोर्ड के पूर्व सदस्य सयूरी शिराई ने एक साक्षात्कार में कहा, \"जुलाई के फैसले की बहुत सारी व्याख्याएं हुईं, क्योंकि यह बहुत जटिल था और हर किसी ने इसे अलग-अलग तरीके से समझा।\". \"मुझे उम्मीद थी कि उएदा-सान थोड़ा स्पष्ट होगा. \"यह पहली बार नहीं है जब बैंक को उपज-वक्र नियंत्रण में बदलाव के बारे में सूचित करने के लिए संघर्ष करना पड़ा है. वास्तव में, हर बार बीओजे ने वाईसीसी को लागू करने के तरीके को बदल दिया है, इसने बहुत अलग तरीके से काम किया है, एक अस्पष्ट सीमा से एक परिभाषित सीमा तक जा रहा है, और अब वापस अस्पष्टता पर आ गया है. ऐसे युग में जब संचार केंद्रीय बैंक का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण उपकरण है, डेटा-संचालित यूएडीए का उद्देश्य स्पष्टता लाना था. उनके पूर्ववर्ती, हारुहिको कुरोदा की चौंकाने वाली और विस्मयकारी रणनीति जानबूझकर बाजार को आश्चर्यचकित करने और यह दिखाने के लिए डिज़ाइन की गई थी कि उनका मतलब इस तरह से व्यवसाय करना था कि मासाकी शिराकावा, जिन्होंने उनसे पहले बैंक का नेतृत्व किया था, को व्यापक रूप से नहीं आंका गया था।. लेकिन कुरोदा के लंबे दशक के कार्यकाल के अंत तक पर्यवेक्षक इससे थक चुके थे. अब, यूएडा को उसी विश्वसनीयता की कमी का सामना करना पड़ रहा है. जबकि बीओजे की नीति के बारे में गलतफहमी आंशिक रूप से इस बात की अज्ञानता को दर्शाती है कि बैंक कैसे काम करता है और जापान की अर्थव्यवस्था कैसे संचालित होती है, यूएडा ने इस बात पर अविश्वास गहरा कर दिया है कि क्या बैंक जो कहता है उसका मतलब है और जो वह कहता है उसका मतलब है।. एक हालिया टिप्पणी स्पष्टता की इस कमी को उजागर करती है. बीओजे 10-वर्षीय बांड के लिए बाजार में कब कदम रखेगा, इस सवाल के जवाब में डिप्टी गवर्नर शिनिची उचिदा ने पिछले सप्ताह कहा, \"इस स्तर पर मेरे दिमाग में कोई विशिष्ट स्तर नहीं है।\". लेकिन फिर उन्होंने एक सार्थक टिप्पणी की: \"मेरा मतलब है, अगर कोई होता तो भी मैं यह नहीं कहता. \"बीओजे संभवतः ईमानदार है जब वह कहता है कि 2 प्रतिशत मूल्य लक्ष्य अभी भी कुछ दूर है, भले ही एक सदस्य को प्रतीत होता है कि यह क्षितिज पर है. लेकिन सिर के नकलीपन के कारण यह जानना मुश्किल हो रहा है कि वह वास्तव में किस पर विश्वास करता है. सावधानी की आवश्यकता, उदारतापूर्वक कहें तो, संपूर्ण वाईसीसी परियोजना में अंतर्निहित हो सकती है. एवरकोर आईएसआई में वैश्विक नीति को कवर करने वाले कृष्णा गुहा ने इस दृष्टिकोण की तुलना विनिमय दर व्यवस्थाओं में बदलाव से की है. आप इस डर से कभी भी इसके बारे में पहले से बात नहीं करते हैं कि सट्टेबाज बहुत आगे निकल जाते हैं और परिणामस्वरूप, आश्चर्य के आवश्यक तत्व को बर्बाद कर देते हैं. उस सादृश्य में कुछ बात है. 1997-98 के एशियाई वित्तीय संकट के दौरान, अवमूल्यन के सवालों का सामना करने पर सरकारों की कार्यप्रणाली इनकार करने या अस्पष्ट करने की थी. अगले वर्षों में लैटिन अमेरिका के साथ भी ऐसा ही हुआ. एक और तुलना है: पूंजी नियंत्रण. सितंबर 1998 में देश से बाहर धन के प्रवाह पर प्रतिबंध लगाने के मलेशिया के फैसले के नेतृत्व में, मंत्री बदलाव की चर्चा को हतोत्साहित करेंगे. शिराई उन लोगों में से हैं जो तर्क देते हैं कि नकारात्मक दरों की गहरी अलोकप्रियता की भरपाई के लिए वाईसीसी स्वयं एक धोखा था, जिसके खिलाफ उन्होंने 2016 की शुरुआत में मतदान किया था।. बीओजे अभी भी उस निर्णय से खुद को बाहर निकालने के लिए काम कर रहा है. जापान में मुद्रा या ऋण संकट नहीं आने वाला है; . लेकिन संचार संकट कुछ और है. यह एक त्रासदी होगी यदि उनके पूर्ववर्ती के दूसरे कार्यकाल के अंत में व्याप्त अविश्वास और संशय, पद की शपथ लेने के कुछ ही महीनों बाद उएदा के कार्यकाल को परिभाषित करने लगे।. अपरंपरागत मौद्रिक नीति के रोमांच और प्रभाव ऐसे ही हैं. बाहर निकलने की तुलना में अंदर जाना आसान है. डेनियल मॉस एशियाई अर्थव्यवस्थाओं को कवर करने वाले ब्लूमबर्ग ओपिनियन स्तंभकार हैं. गियरॉइड रेडी ब्लूमबर्ग ओपिनियन स्तंभकार हैं. विचार व्यक्तिगत हैं, और इस प्रकाशन के रुख का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करते हैं. श्रेय: ब्लूमबर्ग\n",

      "टमाटर और अन्य खाद्य पदार्थों की ऊंची कीमतों के कारण चारों ओर घबराहट होने के बावजूद, भारत की मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) द्वारा अगस्त 2023 की नीति समीक्षा में लगातार तीसरी बार रोक लगाना एक पूर्वनिर्धारित निष्कर्ष था।. नीति ने बहुत कम आश्चर्य उत्पन्न किया, जिसमें सर्वसम्मति से रेपो दर को 6 पर अपरिवर्तित रखने का निर्णय लिया गया. 5 प्रतिशत. 5:1 के मत के साथ, यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए कि मुद्रास्फीति उत्तरोत्तर लक्ष्य के साथ संरेखित हो, विकास का समर्थन करते हुए, आवास की वापसी पर ध्यान केंद्रित रखने पर रुख बरकरार रखा गया।. जबकि आशावादी विकास पूर्वानुमान को अपेक्षित रूप से अपरिवर्तित छोड़ दिया गया था, मुद्रास्फीति पूर्वानुमान को 5 तक बढ़ा दिया गया था. 4 प्रतिशत, हमारी अपेक्षा से अधिक (+5)।. 3 प्रतिशत). इसके अलावा, वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (आई-सीआरआर) को अस्थायी रूप से लागू करना एक आश्चर्य के रूप में आया. जैसा कि अनुमान था, खाद्य और कच्चे तेल की कीमतों और विशेष रूप से अनियमित मानसून वितरण के कारण बढ़ती अनिश्चितताओं को देखते हुए, दस्तावेज़ का स्वर जून 2023 के नीति वक्तव्य की तुलना में अधिक आक्रामक था, भले ही इसकी अंतिम मात्रा सामान्य हो सकती है . एमपीसी ने इस बात पर प्रकाश डाला कि वह मुद्रास्फीति को लक्ष्य के अनुरूप करने के साथ-साथ मुद्रास्फीति की उम्मीदों को नियंत्रित करने की अपनी प्रतिबद्धता पर दृढ़ रहेगी।. पिछली दो नीतियों के अनुरूप, गवर्नर ने एक बार फिर जोर दिया कि सीपीआई मुद्रास्फीति को 2-6 प्रतिशत के सहनशीलता बैंड के भीतर लाना पर्याप्त नहीं है और मुद्रास्फीति को 4 के लक्ष्य के अनुरूप लाने पर ध्यान केंद्रित है।. 0 प्रतिशत. इसके अलावा, उन्होंने इस बात पर चिंता व्यक्त की कि बार-बार होने वाली खाद्य कीमतों के झटके की घटनाएं मुद्रास्फीति की उम्मीदों को नियंत्रित करने के लिए जोखिम पैदा करती हैं, जिससे इस नीति वक्तव्य की कठोरता बढ़ जाती है।. मुद्रास्फीति पर चेतावनी एमपीसी ने यह भी चेतावनी दी कि प्रतिकूल मौसम की स्थिति के कारण आपूर्ति में व्यवधान को देखते हुए तत्काल अवधि में मुख्य मुद्रास्फीति बढ़ने की संभावना है।. जैसे ही बाजार ने यह समझा कि केवल 6 प्रतिशत से नीचे गिरना पर्याप्त नहीं है, जुलाई 2023 के लिए जल्द ही जारी होने वाले प्रिंट में सीपीआई मुद्रास्फीति इस सीमा को जोरदार ढंग से पार करने के लिए तैयार है।. हमें संदेह है कि अल्पकालिक राहत के बाद, जुलाई और अगस्त सीपीआई मुद्रास्फीति प्रिंट 6 की असुविधाजनक सीमा में होंगे. 5-7. 0 प्रतिशत. इसमें कोई आश्चर्य की बात नहीं है कि एमपीसी ने वित्त वर्ष 2024 की दूसरी तिमाही के लिए मुद्रास्फीति के लिए अपने आधारभूत पूर्वानुमान को एक प्रतिशत की भारी वृद्धि के साथ 6 तक बढ़ा दिया है।. 5 से 2 प्रतिशत. 2 प्रतिशत. इसके बाद, यह मुद्रास्फीति को 5 तक कम होते हुए देखता है. वित्त वर्ष 2024 की तीसरी तिमाही में 7 प्रतिशत और फिर 5 प्रतिशत. Q4 FY2024 के साथ-साथ Q1 FY2025 में प्रत्येक में 2 प्रतिशत. उत्तरार्द्ध के आधार पर, हमें अब जून 2024 में दरों में कटौती शुरू होने की उम्मीद नहीं है, और हमने जल्द से जल्द कटौती के लिए अपने पूर्वानुमान को वित्त वर्ष 2025 की दूसरी तिमाही तक बढ़ा दिया है।. इसके अलावा, हमारा अनुमान है कि दर में कटौती का चक्र काफी उथला होगा, जो 50-75 बीपीएस तक सीमित होगा. साथ ही, एमपीसी ने यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए सतर्क रहने और उचित कार्य करने के लिए तैयार रहने की आवश्यकता पर जोर दिया कि झटकों का प्रभाव जारी न रहे।. हालाँकि इसने आश्वस्त किया कि यह विशिष्ट झटकों को देखता है, इसने चेतावनी दी कि यदि ऐसी विलक्षणताएँ बनी रहने के संकेत दिखाती हैं, तो इसे कार्रवाई करनी होगी. इससे दरों में रुक-रुक कर बढ़ोतरी का रास्ता खुला रहता है, हालांकि इसके लिए सीमा काफी ऊंची होगी. हमारे विचार में, मुद्रास्फीति को 6 से ऊपर बने रहने की आवश्यकता होगी. मुख्य मुद्रास्फीति पर दबाव के संचरण के बीच, दर में बढ़ोतरी के लिए मंच तैयार करने के लिए, कम से कम दो तिमाहियों के लिए 0 प्रतिशत. विकास को लेकर आशावादी बाहरी चुनौतियों और मानसून संबंधी जोखिमों के बावजूद, एमपीसी घरेलू उपभोग और निवेश की संभावनाओं को लेकर काफी उत्साहित रही।. हम 76 के क्षमता उपयोग के आंकड़े से विशेष रूप से उत्साहित हैं. वित्त वर्ष 2023 की चौथी तिमाही के लिए 3 प्रतिशत, और एक टिकाऊ और व्यापक-आधारित, यद्यपि यथार्थवादी, क्षमता विस्तार चक्र सेटिंग के बारे में सावधानीपूर्वक आशावादी हैं. इसके अलावा, केंद्र और राज्य सरकार दोनों का पूंजीगत व्यय पिछले दो वर्षों में पूर्व-कोविड स्तरों से काफी ऊपर चला गया है. हालांकि कार्यान्वयन महत्वपूर्ण रहेगा, हम उम्मीद करते हैं कि सरकार मध्यम अवधि में पूंजीगत व्यय के लिए आवंटन को प्राथमिकता देना जारी रखेगी, जिससे विकास की संभावनाओं को समर्थन मिलेगा।. हमारे अनुमान के अनुसार, I-CRR पर उपाय से बैंकिंग प्रणाली की लगभग 900-950 बिलियन रुपये की तरलता जब्त हो जाएगी।. परिणामस्वरूप, हम उम्मीद करते हैं कि कॉल मनी दरें, ट्रेजरी बिल और वाणिज्यिक पत्र जैसे मुद्रा बाजार उपकरणों पर अल्पकालिक दरें निकट अवधि में 15-20 बीपीएस बढ़ जाएंगी।. नीति की घोषणा के बाद, मौजूदा बेंचमार्क 10-वर्षीय सरकारी सुरक्षा की उपज में गिरावट आई, हालांकि एक संकीर्ण सीमा में. एक नई बेंचमार्क सुरक्षा का शुक्रवार को अनावरण होने वाला है. सीमित राजकोषीय चिंताओं और एमपीसी से विस्तारित विराम की उच्च संभावना के बीच, हम 7 की सीमा में इसकी उपज की उम्मीद करते हैं. 1-7. अगले दो महीनों में 2 प्रतिशत. तरलता की अधिकता को समाप्त करने के उपाय के परिणामस्वरूप, उपज वक्र तत्काल अवधि में और अधिक समतल होने की संभावना है. अदिति नायर मुख्य अर्थशास्त्री और प्रमुख-अनुसंधान एवं प्रमुख हैं। . विचार व्यक्तिगत हैं, और इस प्रकाशन के रुख का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करते हैं\n",

      "जहां तक ​​नीतिगत दरों का सवाल है, भारतीय रिज़र्व बैंक (आरबीआई) का अपने मौद्रिक नीति वक्तव्य में दर निर्णय काफी हद तक अपेक्षित - यथास्थिति पर था।. फरवरी की नीति के बाद से, हम उम्मीद कर रहे हैं कि आरबीआई एक विस्तारित विराम मोड में रहेगा, और वर्तमान नीति निर्णय हमारी अपेक्षाओं के अनुरूप है।. खाद्य और सब्जियों की कीमतों में हालिया बढ़ोतरी निकट भविष्य के लिए चिंता का विषय रही है, क्योंकि यह उपभोक्ता मूल्य मुद्रास्फीति (सीपीआई) के नीचे की ओर अस्थायी रूप से बाधित होती है, जिसे आरबीआई अपनी मौद्रिक नीति कार्रवाइयों और तरलता के माध्यम से सफलतापूर्वक हासिल करने में सक्षम रहा है। . मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) ने Q2FY24 के लिए अपने मुद्रास्फीति पूर्वानुमान को उल्लेखनीय रूप से (100 बीपीएस) बढ़ाकर 6 कर दिया है।. 2 प्रतिशत, जो आरबीआई के सहनशीलता बैंड की 6 प्रतिशत ऊपरी सीमा से परे है. एमपीसी ने अपने सीपीआई अनुमानों को तीसरी तिमाही के लिए 30 बीपीएस और पूरे वित्त वर्ष 2023-24 के लिए कुल मिलाकर 30 बीपीएस बढ़ा दिया है।. हालाँकि, जैसा कि हम उम्मीद कर रहे थे, एमपीसी ने खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति में मौजूदा वृद्धि (गैर-मौसमी बारिश, अल नीनो, आदि के कारण) पर गौर करने का निर्णय लिया है।. ), क्योंकि यह इस स्पाइक को अस्थायी मानता है. हालाँकि, उल्लेखनीय बात यह है कि आरबीआई ने Q1FY25 (i) के लिए सीपीआई का अनुमान लगाया है. इ. , अगले वित्तीय वर्ष के अप्रैल-जून) ऊंचे 5 पर. 2 प्रतिशत. 4 के गवर्नर द्वारा निरंतर सुदृढीकरण को देखते हुए. 0 प्रतिशत औसत सीपीआई लक्ष्य, नवीनतम पूर्वानुमान मूल रूप से वित्त वर्ष 2014 में किसी भी दर में कटौती की उम्मीदों को खारिज कर देते हैं. जब तक वैश्विक विकास में कोई महत्वपूर्ण गिरावट नहीं होती जिसका घरेलू विकास पर प्रभाव पड़ता है, यह बहुत कम संभावना लगती है कि आरबीआई चालू वित्तीय वर्ष के दौरान अपना रुख बदलेगा।. यह भी पढ़ें: मुद्रास्फीति के खिलाफ लड़ाई में, एमपीसी मुश्किल स्थिति के बीच फंसी हुई है। इस नीति वक्तव्य में थोड़ा आश्चर्यचकित करने वाला तत्व शुद्ध मांग पर 10 प्रतिशत वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (आई-सीआरआर के रूप में संदर्भित) की शुरूआत थी। . गवर्नर ने स्वीकार किया है कि आरबीआई की परिवर्तनीय दर रिवर्स रेपो (वीआरआरआर) नीलामी से तरलता की निकासी पर पूर्ण वांछित प्रभाव नहीं पड़ रहा है, जो अधिशेष मोड में है, क्योंकि बैंक वीआरआरआर के बजाय अपनी अतिरिक्त तरलता को एसडीएफ विंडो में रखना पसंद कर रहे हैं। . आई-सीआरआर उपाय का उद्देश्य अस्थायी (8 सितंबर तक संभव) और गैर-विघटनकारी होना है; . कुल मिलाकर, आरबीआई की नीति एक ओर मुद्रास्फीति पर नियंत्रण और दूसरी ओर तरलता को सीमित रखते हुए विकास को समर्थन देने के बीच सामंजस्यपूर्ण संतुलन बनाए रखने पर केंद्रित है।. तरलता को मजबूत करने पर केंद्रीय बैंक के फोकस के कारण निकट अवधि में उपज वक्र सपाट बने रहेंगे. यह भी पढ़ें: दास का कहना है कि मुद्रास्फीति के आंकड़ों पर बिना सोचे-समझे प्रतिक्रिया देने से बचना चाहिए। यह नीति, हालांकि पिछली नीति की तुलना में कम कठोर प्रतीत होती है, दर में कटौती या यहां तक ​​कि नीतिगत रुख (लंबे समय से चली आ रही नीति) को कमजोर करने की किसी भी उम्मीद को और पीछे धकेल देती है। . अगले कुछ महीनों में घरेलू ब्याज दरें ऊंची बनी रहेंगी, जब तक कि हेडलाइन सीपीआई के नीचे की ओर प्रक्षेपवक्र फिर से शुरू न हो जाए, या विकास की स्थिति सार्थक रूप से कम न हो जाए।. वर्तमान परिदृश्य में, निवेशक उच्च ब्याज दर व्यवस्था का लाभ उठा सकते हैं और लघु-मध्यम अवधि की निश्चित आय के अवसरों में निवेश कर सकते हैं, जबकि लंबी अवधि के निवेश के लिए आवंटन को लंबे निवेश क्षितिज को ध्यान में रखते हुए अधिमानतः क्रमबद्ध किया जा सकता है।. अस्वीकरण: मनीकंट्रोल पर निवेश विशेषज्ञों द्वारा व्यक्त विचार और निवेश युक्तियाँ. com उनका अपना है न कि वेबसाइट या उसके प्रबंधन का. मोनेकॉंट्रोल. कॉम उपयोगकर्ताओं को कोई भी निवेश निर्णय लेने से पहले प्रमाणित विशेषज्ञों से जांच करने की सलाह देता है\n",

      "प्रिय पाठक, विभिन्न लोगों के लिए एक कहावत है: 'ज्ञान यह जानना है कि टमाटर एक फल है, ज्ञान इसे फलों के सलाद में डालना नहीं है'. फिर भी मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) ने अपनी शाश्वत शर्मिंदगी के लिए कहा, \"आगे चलकर, टमाटर के नेतृत्व में सब्जियों की कीमतों में बढ़ोतरी, निकट अवधि की हेडलाइन मुद्रास्फीति प्रक्षेपवक्र पर बड़ा दबाव डालेगी।\". \"स्पष्ट रूप से, उन्हें इस बात का ज्ञान नहीं है कि टमाटर एक फल है, वास्तव में ऐसा माना जाता है कि इसमें कामोत्तेजक शक्तियाँ होती हैं, जैसा कि फ्रांसीसी द्वारा इसे पोमे डी'अमोर, या लव एप्पल कहकर प्रमाणित किया गया है।. इसका फायदा यह है कि, इसी तर्क से, एमपीसी सदस्यों द्वारा फलों के सलाद में टमाटर डालने की संभावना नहीं है, इस प्रकार उनके पास जो ज्ञान की कमी है उसे समझदारी से पूरा किया जा सकता है।. चालू वित्त वर्ष के लिए खुदरा मुद्रास्फीति का पूर्वानुमान 5 तक बढ़ाने के बावजूद, खाद्य कीमतों में वृद्धि को कम मुद्रास्फीति से परे देखने और नीति दर को अपरिवर्तित रखने के उनके दृढ़ संकल्प में यह बुद्धिमत्ता दिखाई देती है।. 4 प्रतिशत, 5 से ऊपर. जून में पिछली एमपीसी बैठक में 1 प्रतिशत का अनुमान लगाया गया था. दूसरे तरीके से कहें तो, व्यापक धारणा के बावजूद कि टमाटर की कीमतें गर्म आलू हैं, एमपीसी को लगता है कि यह छोटा आलू है. हालाँकि, इसका मतलब यह नहीं है कि आरबीआई गवर्नर खीरे की तरह शांत हैं और वह टमाटर के बारे में कुछ नहीं बताते हैं. उन्होंने कहा, 'हालाँकि, बार-बार खाद्य कीमतों में झटके लगने की घटनाएं मुद्रास्फीति की उम्मीदों के स्थिर होने का जोखिम पैदा करती हैं।'. उन्होंने आगे कहा, 'हमें जरूरत पड़ने पर नीतिगत उपकरणों को तैनात करने के लिए अर्जुन की नजर से परे जाने के लिए तैयार रहना होगा. 'जैसा कि मेरी सहकर्मी अपर्णा अय्यर बताती हैं, इन उपकरणों में वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात में वृद्धि शामिल हो सकती है, जो तरलता को प्रभावित करेगी।. जबकि मुद्रास्फीति का परिदृश्य थोड़ा निराशाजनक है, एमपीसी विकास के बारे में संभावनाओं से भरी है. FY24 के लिए ग्रोथ का अनुमान 6 पर बरकरार रखा गया है. 5 प्रतिशत. इसके अलावा, आरबीआई गवर्नर ने यह भी कहा, 'बैंकों और अन्य स्रोतों से वाणिज्यिक क्षेत्र में संसाधनों का कुल प्रवाह ₹7 तक बढ़ गया है।. वित्तीय वर्ष 2023-24 के दौरान अब तक (28 जुलाई तक) ₹5 की तुलना में 5 लाख करोड़ रु.. एक साल पहले 7 लाख करोड़ रु. 'यह 31 की वृद्धि है. एक वर्ष पहले की तुलना में 6 प्रतिशत, केंद्रीय बैंक द्वारा दरों में बढ़ोतरी के बावजूद, अर्थव्यवस्था में मजबूत विकास गति का प्रमाण है. उस तरह की विकास गति और प्रचुर तरलता के साथ, क्या मुद्रास्फीति का व्यापक अर्थव्यवस्था पर असर पड़ने का जोखिम हो सकता है? . यह इतना छोटा-सा छोटा-सा कदम है कि इसने मुझे प्रसिद्ध गीत की इन पंक्तियों की याद दिला दी: वह लॉकर से बाहर आने से डर रही थी वह उतनी ही घबराई हुई थी जितनी वह हो सकती थी. जो भी हो, आरबीआई ने दोहराया है कि वह 'मुद्रास्फीति को 4 के लक्ष्य तक लाने पर दृढ़ता से ध्यान केंद्रित कर रहा है'. 0 प्रतिशत', जिसका मतलब है कि इस वित्तीय वर्ष में किसी भी दर में कटौती की संभावना कम है - नीति दर लंबे समय तक ऊंची रहेगी. क्या इसका मतलब यह है कि विकास धीमा हो जाएगा? . ऐसा नहीं लगता कि बढ़ती ब्याज दरों ने विकास को रोका है या मुनाफ़े को प्रभावित किया है. और सरकार निश्चित है कि अगले साल आम चुनाव से पहले खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति को कम करने के लिए वह सब कुछ करेगी जो वह कर सकती है. आरबीआई गवर्नर दास ने यह भी कहा कि सरकारी पूंजीगत व्यय, बढ़ती व्यावसायिक आशावाद और कुछ प्रमुख क्षेत्रों में निजी पूंजीगत व्यय में पुनरुद्धार के कारण निवेश गतिविधि में तेजी आई है।. निर्माण गतिविधि मजबूत बनी हुई है. इसके अलावा, दास ने स्पष्ट रूप से कहा, 'कुल मांग की स्थिति लगातार अच्छी बनी हुई है.

      "भारतीय रिजर्व बैंक (आरबीआई) की मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) ने ब्याज दरों पर अपनी पीठ थपथपाई है, जबकि उन्नत देशों के केंद्रीय बैंकों ने दरों में बढ़ोतरी जारी रखी है।. 2,000 रुपये के नोटों की वापसी से बनी अतिरिक्त तरलता को खत्म करने के लिए वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात की शुरूआत, जिसकी उम्मीद नहीं थी, अल्पकालिक दरों को अस्थायी रूप से सख्त कर सकती है।. हालाँकि, RBI का नीतिगत रुख बाज़ारों के लिए कोई आश्चर्य की बात नहीं है. जाहिर है, उन्नत देशों में दरों में बढ़ोतरी अधिक आक्रामक रही है क्योंकि वे भारत की तुलना में अधिक मुद्रास्फीति की चुनौती का सामना कर रहे हैं. उदाहरण के लिए, अमेरिकी फेडरल रिजर्व ने वर्तमान लंबी पैदल यात्रा चक्र में दरों में भारत के 250 बीपीएस के मुकाबले 525 आधार अंक (बीपीएस) की बढ़ोतरी की है।. जबकि फेड की नवीनतम बढ़ोतरी वर्तमान चक्र के लिए आखिरी हो सकती है, यूरोपीय सेंट्रल बैंक से नीति को सख्त करने की उम्मीद है क्योंकि उसके दायरे में मुद्रास्फीति स्थिर रही है. कुल मिलाकर, पश्चिम में ब्याज दरें लंबे समय तक ऊंची रहने की संभावना है, क्योंकि हेडलाइन मुद्रास्फीति रेडलाइन से ऊपर बनी हुई है और मुख्य मुद्रास्फीति स्थिर है।. इसके विपरीत, मुद्रास्फीति में नरमी के कारण एशिया में मौद्रिक नीति पर दबाव कम हो गया है. मुद्रास्फीति फिर से बढ़ी मुद्रास्फीति पर आरबीआई की सावधानी ने इसे अच्छी स्थिति में खड़ा कर दिया है क्योंकि मुद्रास्फीति, जो जून की नीति घोषणा के दौरान चरम पर थी, फिर से बढ़ गई है. मिंट रोड लगातार बता रहा है कि लड़ाई अभी ख़त्म नहीं हुई है और अगस्त की नीति समीक्षा इस रुख को दोहराती है. पहली तिमाही में मजबूत आर्थिक वृद्धि को देखते हुए, आरबीआई ने भारत की जीडीपी वृद्धि के लिए अपने पूर्वानुमान को 6 पर अपरिवर्तित रखा. 5 प्रतिशत. लेकिन खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति में हालिया बढ़ोतरी ने आरबीआई के जुलाई-सितंबर सीपीआई पूर्वानुमान 5 को बढ़ा दिया है. 2 प्रतिशत - यह संख्या अब बढ़कर 6 हो गई है. 2 प्रतिशत. चालू वित्त वर्ष के लिए, उसे उम्मीद है कि सीपीआई मुद्रास्फीति प्रिंट 5 होगी. जून के पूर्वानुमान से 4 प्रतिशत या 30 बीपीएस अधिक. विभिन्न संकेतक पहली तिमाही में समग्र रूप से मजबूत विकास गति की ओर इशारा करते हैं. सरकारी निवेश तेजी से बढ़ा है और ऋण वृद्धि काफी अच्छी है. परचेजिंग मैनेजर्स इंडेक्स मजबूत विस्तार क्षेत्र में था और जुलाई को समाप्त होने वाले चार महीनों के दौरान विनिर्माण और सेवाओं के लिए इसका औसत क्रमशः 58 और 61 था।. माल निर्यात में लगातार पांच महीनों तक गिरावट जारी रही, लेकिन इससे समग्र आर्थिक गतिविधि धीमी नहीं हुई है. दिलचस्प बात यह है कि ऊंची वृद्धि मुद्रास्फीति पर बढ़ते दबाव का मुख्य कारण नहीं है. बल्कि इसके लिए खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति दोषी है. मुख्य मुद्रास्फीति के सेवा भाग के विपरीत, जो सेवाओं की मजबूत मांग के कारण दबाव में रहता है, माल खुदरा मुद्रास्फीति में लगातार गिरावट देखी जा रही है।. उपभोक्ता मूल्य सूचकांक (सीपीआई) में एक तिहाई भार के साथ वस्तु मुद्रास्फीति, इनपुट लागत में तेज सुधार के कारण जून 2023 में पिछले साल के इसी महीने की तुलना में 12 प्रतिशत कम हो गई।. थोक मूल्य सूचकांक का गैर-खाद्य हिस्सा, जो इनपुट लागत का एक प्रॉक्सी है, जून में साल दर साल गिर गया. कंपनियों ने लागत कटौती का कुछ हिस्सा अंतिम उपभोक्ता को दिया है और दूसरे का उपयोग लाभ मार्जिन को कम करने के लिए किया है. यह प्रवृत्ति पूरे वर्ष जारी रहने की संभावना है, जैसा कि आईआईएम अहमदाबाद के बिजनेस इन्फ्लेशन एक्सपेक्टेशन सर्वे द्वारा सुझाया गया है - फर्मों की औसत वर्ष-आगे की मुद्रास्फीति उम्मीदें लगातार दो महीनों तक 4 प्रतिशत के भीतर रहीं।. इसके अतिरिक्त, उच्च आधार प्रभाव के कारण ईंधन मुद्रास्फीति कम एकल अंक में है क्योंकि कच्चे तेल की कीमतें पिछले साल के स्तर से पीछे चल रही हैं. अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर कच्चे तेल की कीमतों में जारी बढ़ोतरी इस मोर्चे पर चिंताएं बढ़ाती है. मुख्य मुद्रास्फीति का सेवा घटक, जिसका सीपीआई में 27 प्रतिशत भार है, नीचे आया लेकिन पिछले कुछ महीनों में स्थिर रहा है. खाद्य कीमतों से दबाव खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति, 40 प्रतिशत भार के साथ, मुद्रास्फीति का विशिष्ट हिस्सा है. अनाज, दालों और मसालों की महंगाई दोहरे अंक में है और मौसम और कीटों के झटके के कारण सब्जियों की कीमतें तेजी से बढ़ी हैं. सब्जियों की महंगाई, जहां बढ़ोतरी आम तौर पर अस्थायी होती है और लगभग दो महीनों में सही हो जाती है, कोई स्थायी चिंता नहीं है. लेकिन घरेलू और वैश्विक कारकों के कारण खाद्यान्न मुद्रास्फीति मुश्किल साबित हो सकती है. हमारे शोध से पता चलता है कि मानसून सामान्य होने पर भी खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति अधिक हो सकती है. उदाहरण के लिए, पिछले चार सामान्य मानसून वर्षों में से तीन में खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति 6 प्रतिशत से अधिक रही. अधिक बारिश और देरी से बुआई के कारण खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति का खतरा सब्जियों पर मंडरा रहा है. मानसून के मौसम के उत्तरार्ध में शुष्क परिस्थितियों से जुड़े कमजोर अल नीनो की संभावना की पुष्टि भारतीय मौसम विभाग ने हाल ही में की थी. वैश्विक परिप्रेक्ष्य से, अल नीनो अन्य प्रमुख वैश्विक उत्पादक अर्थव्यवस्थाओं में फसलों के लिए भी जोखिम है, जैसे इंडोनेशिया और मलेशिया में पाम तेल और थाईलैंड और वियतनाम में चावल।. इनमें से पाम तेल भारत के लिए प्रमुख आयात है. वर्तमान में, खाद्य तेल की कीमतें पिछले साल की तुलना में कम हैं, लेकिन एक वैश्विक झटका इसे उलट सकता है. रिकॉर्ड के लिए, भारत अपनी खाद्य तेल आवश्यकता का 60 प्रतिशत आयात करता है. खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति के बारे में चिंता सरकार द्वारा उठाए जा रहे एहतियाती कदमों से स्पष्ट है, जैसे कि कुछ प्रकार के चावल के निर्यात पर प्रतिबंध लगाना, गेहूं पर भंडारण सीमा लगाना और कम कीमतों पर बाजार में हस्तक्षेप करना।. इस परिदृश्य में, हम उम्मीद करते हैं कि अगले साल की शुरुआत में दर में कटौती होगी यदि मौजूदा खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति का दबाव क्षणभंगुर साबित होता है और हेडलाइन मुद्रास्फीति अनुमानित प्रक्षेपवक्र पर बनी रहती है।. हालाँकि आरबीआई की दरों में बढ़ोतरी सीधे आपूर्ति-संचालित खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति को प्रभावित नहीं कर सकती है, लेकिन यह एक चिंता का विषय बन जाता है अगर यह कायम रहती है, अन्य घटकों तक फैल जाती है, और हेडलाइन मुद्रास्फीति को अपने लक्ष्य से दूर ले जाती है. इसलिए, मिंट रोड खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति पर अपनी नजरें गड़ाए रखेगा. धर्मकीर्ति जोशी क्रिसिल के मुख्य अर्थशास्त्री हैं. विचार व्यक्तिगत हैं, और इस प्रकाशन के रुख का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करते हैं\n",
      "घरेलू यात्री वाहन थोक बिक्री में वृद्धि 2. जुलाई में 94%: सियाम\n",
      "घरेलू यात्री वाहनों की थोक बिक्री 2 दर्ज की गई. सोसायटी ऑफ इंडियन ऑटोमोबाइल मैन्युफैक्चरर्स ने गुरुवार को कहा कि जुलाई में साल-दर-साल 94 फीसदी की बढ़ोतरी के साथ 3,02,521 यूनिट्स की बढ़ोतरी हुई।. सोसाइटी ऑफ इंडियन ऑटोमोबाइल मैन्युफैक्चरर्स (सियाम) द्वारा जारी नवीनतम आंकड़ों के अनुसार, जुलाई 2022 में निर्माताओं से डीलरों तक यात्री वाहनों (पीवी) की डिलीवरी 2,93,865 इकाई थी।. पिछले महीने दोपहिया वाहनों की घरेलू थोक बिक्री घटकर 12,82,054 इकाई रह गई, जबकि जुलाई 2022 में यह 13,81,303 इकाई थी।. तिपहिया वाहनों की थोक बिक्री 56,034 इकाई रही, जो एक साल पहले इसी महीने में 31,324 इकाई थी।. सियाम ने कहा कि विभिन्न श्रेणियों में कुल वाहन डिस्पैच 16,40,727 इकाइयां थीं, जबकि जुलाई 2022 में यह 17,06,545 इकाइयां थीं।. “हालांकि यात्री वाहन और तिपहिया खंड अच्छा प्रदर्शन कर रहे हैं, जुलाई 2022 की तुलना में जुलाई 2023 में दोपहिया वाहनों की वृद्धि में गिरावट आई है।. SIAM के अध्यक्ष विनोद अग्रवाल SIAM ने कहा, \"कुल मिलाकर, हमें उम्मीद है कि सकारात्मक आर्थिक माहौल, अच्छा मानसून और आगामी त्योहारी सीजन ऑटो उद्योग में निरंतर वृद्धि का समर्थन करेगा।\"\n",
      "WeWork की कांच की दीवारें बंद होने लगी हैं\n",
      "जब WeWork Inc अंततः 2021 में सार्वजनिक हुआ, तो आशा थी कि यह उन ज्यादतियों को पीछे छोड़ देगा जो सह-संस्थापक एडम न्यूमैन के नेतृत्व की पहचान थीं और घर से काम करने के युग के लिए एक गंभीर लचीला कार्यक्षेत्र प्रदाता बन जाएगा।. कंपनी की दूसरी तिमाही के नतीजों में शामिल इस सप्ताह की \"चल रही चिंता\" चेतावनी से पता चलता है कि अगले 12 महीने चार साल पहले WeWork के लगभग विस्फोट के समान ही भयावह होंगे।. प्रभावी उपचारात्मक कार्रवाई या अन्य पूंजी जुटाने के अभाव में, यह बंद हो सकता है. 2019 में सार्वजनिक होने के अपने पहले विनाशकारी प्रयास के बाद से WeWork ने सैकड़ों रियल एस्टेट पट्टों को समाप्त कर दिया है और निश्चित लागत और पूंजीगत व्यय में कटौती की है; . मार्च में ऋण पुनर्गठन ने अपनी उधारी को कम करके, ब्याज भुगतान को कम करके और 2027 तक परिपक्वता अवधि बढ़ाकर अतिरिक्त राहत की गुंजाइश हासिल की।. हालाँकि, कंपनी की बैलेंस शीट अभी भी ख़राब है और उसे बड़ी मात्रा में धन का नुकसान हो रहा है, पिछले छह महीनों में $650 मिलियन का नुकसान हुआ है और नकदी भंडार घटकर केवल $205 मिलियन रह गया है।. एक दशक से भी अधिक समय पहले स्थापित होने के बाद से WeWork को लगभग $17 बिलियन का नुकसान हुआ है. निराशाजनक वाणिज्यिक रियल एस्टेट बाजार में इस स्थिति को सुधारना कठिन होगा: टेक ग्राहक बजट में कटौती कर रहे हैं और WeWork अपनी अधिकांश बिक्री अमेरिका और ब्रिटेन में उत्पन्न करता है - मुख्य रूप से लंदन, सैन फ्रांसिस्को और न्यूयॉर्क जैसे बड़े शहरों में जहां सर्फ़ बढ़ रहा है . निश्चित रूप से, भवन मालिक नहीं चाहेंगे कि इतना महत्वपूर्ण पट्टेदार विफल हो जाए, जिससे उनके पास एक ही बार में किराए पर देने के लिए बड़ी मात्रा में जगह बच जाए।. इसलिए WeWork के पास पट्टों पर फिर से बातचीत करने का अधिकार है, जिनमें से कुछ नवीनीकरण के लिए आ रहे हैं. (हालाँकि, दीर्घकालिक पट्टों को रद्द करना सीधा नहीं है, और इसके लिए समाप्ति शुल्क भुगतान की आवश्यकता हो सकती है). कंपनी को अधिक किरायेदारों को आकर्षित करके राजस्व बढ़ाने की सख्त जरूरत है, लेकिन इसके विपरीत हो रहा है: दिसंबर से सदस्यता में 3 प्रतिशत की गिरावट आई है, जबकि इसी अवधि के दौरान अधिभोग 75 प्रतिशत से गिरकर 72 प्रतिशत हो गया है।. आईडब्ल्यूजी पीएलसी जैसे प्रतिद्वंद्वी साझा कार्यक्षेत्र प्रदाताओं के साथ प्रतिस्पर्धा के कारण सदस्यता की कीमतें बढ़ाना मुश्किल है, जो कि वेवर्क की घोषणा के बाद बुधवार को लंदन ट्रेडिंग में 10 प्रतिशत तक बढ़ गई।. WeWork को दृढ़ नेतृत्व की आवश्यकता है, लेकिन इसके बजाय वह खुद को एक खालीपन के साथ पाता है: मुख्य कार्यकारी अधिकारी संदीप मथरानी और मुख्य वित्तीय अधिकारी आंद्रे फर्नांडीज दोनों ने मई में अप्रत्याशित रूप से पद छोड़ दिया. मथरानी कमरे में एक आश्वस्त समझदार वयस्क थीं और, अब तक कंपनी ने किसी स्थायी प्रतिस्थापन का नाम नहीं दिया है. नवीनतम खातों के अनुसार, मतभेद की भावना को बढ़ाते हुए, प्रशासन और कंपनी की रणनीतिक और सामरिक दिशा के संबंध में \"भौतिक असहमति\" के कारण तीन बोर्ड निदेशकों ने पिछले सप्ताह इस्तीफा दे दिया।. आधिकारिक स्वीकृति कि कंपनी का नकदी भंडार अगले 12 महीनों तक जीवित रहने के लिए पर्याप्त नहीं हो सकता है, ग्राहकों को और अधिक परेशान करेगा. फाइलिंग में कहा गया है, \"यह धारणा कि हम एक चालू कंपनी के रूप में जारी रखने में सक्षम नहीं हो सकते हैं, हमारे अनुबंध संबंधी दायित्वों को पूरा करने की हमारी क्षमता के बारे में चिंताओं के कारण सदस्यों, मकान मालिकों और अन्य लोगों को हमारे साथ व्यापार नहीं करने का विकल्प चुन सकते हैं।\". WeWork ग्राहकों को खोने का जोखिम नहीं उठा सकता क्योंकि इसके बाद उसे उनकी सुरक्षा जमा राशि वापस करनी पड़ सकती है, जिससे नकदी की और अधिक खपत होगी. इस साल की शुरुआत में जब WeWork के ऋण का कुछ हिस्सा इक्विटी में बांट दिया गया था, तब शेयरधारकों में भारी गिरावट आई थी - लिस्टिंग के बाद से स्टॉक में 98 प्रतिशत की गिरावट आई है. WeWork का ऋण जल्द ही परिपक्व होने वाला नहीं है, लेकिन इसके बांडधारक भी पूर्ण वसूली के बारे में आशावादी नहीं हैं; . 2025 में परिपक्व होने वाले 875 प्रतिशत वरिष्ठ असुरक्षित नोटों का इस सप्ताह डॉलर पर केवल 33 सेंट पर कारोबार हुआ. हालाँकि ऋण पुनर्गठन ने कंपनी को कुछ हद तक ढीला कर दिया, लगभग 500 मिलियन डॉलर की उधारी पर एक अस्थायी ब्याज दर है जो 15 प्रतिशत तक बढ़ गई है. जुलाई में 475 मिलियन डॉलर की सॉफ्टबैंक ग्रुप कॉर्प संबद्ध ऋण सुविधा से 175 मिलियन डॉलर निकालने का कंपनी का निर्णय भी आश्वस्त करने वाला नहीं है - मई में, पूर्व प्रबंधन ने कहा था कि इसकी कोई आवश्यकता नहीं थी, जबकि यह स्वीकार करते हुए कि कंपनी दूसरी छमाही तक कैशफ्लो ब्रेकईवन तक नहीं पहुंच पाएगी। . बड़ा अज्ञात यह है कि बहुसंख्यक मालिक सॉफ्टबैंक फिर से बचाव के लिए आगे आएगा या नहीं. वॉल स्ट्रीट जर्नल के अनुसार, जापानी तकनीकी निवेशक ने अपने WeWork दुस्साहस पर 2017 से $12 बिलियन की भारी रकम खो दी है।. एक और बेलआउट अप्रभावी है - लेकिन इसके बिना, WeWork की संभावनाएँ धूमिल दिखती हैं. क्रिस ब्रायंट यूरोप में औद्योगिक कंपनियों को कवर करने वाले ब्लूमबर्ग ओपिनियन स्तंभकार हैं. विचार व्यक्तिगत हैं और इस प्रकाशन के रुख का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करते हैं. श्रेय: ब्लूमबर्ग\n",

      "बेंगलुरु शहर पुलिस द्वारा शहर के तकनीकी गलियारे में कंपनियों को सुझाए गए यातायात-घटाने के उपायों में कार्यालय समय में बदलाव, कारपूलिंग और कर्मचारियों के लिए समर्पित बसें शामिल हैं।. यह हैदराबाद द्वारा बाधित यातायात से निपटने के लिए इसी तरह के उपायों को लागू करने के बाद आया है. बेंगलुरु शहर के पुलिस आयुक्त बी दयानंद और वरिष्ठ पुलिस अधिकारियों ने संपर्क दिवस में भाग लिया, जो आउटर रिंग रोड पर आईटी-बीटी कंपनियों के साथ कर्नाटक के गृह मंत्री जी परमेश्वर की बैठक से पहले एक आउटरीच कार्यक्रम था, जो बेंगलुरु का तकनीकी गलियारा है।. तकनीकी कंपनियों और आउटर रिंग रोड कंपनीज एसोसिएशन (ओआरआरसीए) के प्रतिनिधियों के साथ 9 अगस्त को सुबह 11 बजे से दोपहर 1 बजे तक बाहरी रिंग रोड पर बेलंदूर में इकोस्पेस बिजनेस पार्क में यातायात प्रबंधन से लेकर सुरक्षा तक विभिन्न मुद्दों पर चर्चा करने के लिए बैठक हुई।. संयुक्त पुलिस आयुक्त (बेंगलुरु ट्रैफिक) एमएन अनुचेथ ने मनीकंट्रोल को बताया कि उन्होंने ट्रैफिक को सुव्यवस्थित करने के लिए ओआरआरसीए और तकनीकी कंपनियों को कई उपाय सुझाए हैं।. इन उपायों में विशेष रूप से लॉग-आउट के लिए कार्यालय समय को चौंका देना शामिल है; . \"कार्यालय के समय में परिवर्तन से हमें यातायात को सुव्यवस्थित करने में मदद मिलेगी, खासकर शाम के समय. हमारा इरादा उन पर कोई विशेष समय थोपने का नहीं है, बल्कि उन्हें अपने आंतरिक मूल्यांकन के आधार पर उपयुक्त समय तय करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करना है।. इस तरह, विभिन्न कंपनियों के लॉग-आउट मेल नहीं खाएंगे,\" उन्होंने समझाया. साइबराबाद पुलिस ने भी आईटी कंपनियों को घर से काम (डब्ल्यूएफएच) करने और धीरे-धीरे लॉग-आउट करने की सलाह दी थी।. अनुचेथ ने कहा कि उन्होंने आउटर रिंग रोड (ओआरआर) पर काम करने वाले कर्मचारियों के लिए समर्पित बसों का प्रस्ताव रखा और ओआरआर पर निजी वाहनों की संख्या कम करने के लिए कारपूलिंग पर जोर दिया।. मनीकंट्रोल ने खबर दी थी कि 6. सिल्क बोर्ड और केआर पुरम के बीच प्रतिदिन 4 लाख कर्मचारी 3 का उपयोग करके आवागमन करते हैं. निजी कारों और कैब सहित 3 लाख वाहन. अनुचेथ ने कहा, ''निजी कैब वर्तमान में ओआरआर की सर्विस रोड पर खड़ी हैं. हमने परिसरों के भीतर इन वाहनों के लिए पार्किंग स्थान बनाने की अनुमति देने का सुझाव दिया है, यह देखते हुए कि उनका उपयोग उनके कर्मचारियों द्वारा किया जाता है. उन्होंने ओआरआरसीए से कर्मचारियों को अंतिम-मील कनेक्टिविटी प्रदान करने के लिए इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स सिटी इंडस्ट्रियल टाउनशिप अथॉरिटी (ईएलसीआईटीए) के समान निकटतम मेट्रो स्टेशनों तक बसें संचालित करने का भी आग्रह किया।. अनुचेथ ने कहा, \"एक बार जब केआर पुरम-बयप्पनहल्ली खंड और सिल्क बोर्ड स्टेशन (आरवी रोड-बोम्मसंद्रा) चालू हो जाते हैं, तो ओआरआरसीए और कंपनियां उन जलग्रहण क्षेत्रों की पहचान करने के लिए एक मूल और गंतव्य अध्ययन कर सकती हैं जहां से ये कर्मचारी आ रहे हैं।\". इससे कर्मचारियों के लिए प्रथम-मील, अंतिम-मील कनेक्टिविटी का प्रावधान सक्षम होगा. जबकि केआर पुरम-बयप्पनहल्ली मेट्रो खंड अगस्त-सितंबर 2023 तक चालू होने की उम्मीद है, सिल्क बोर्ड स्टेशन दिसंबर 2023 तक तैयार होने की संभावना है।. दयानंद ने कहा कि बेंगलुरु ट्रैफिक को मैनेज करना एक कठिन काम है. \"हर कोई यातायात प्रबंधन पर अपनी राय रखता है, क्रिकेट विशेषज्ञों की तरह. सार्वजनिक परिवहन को मजबूत करना और पैदल यात्रियों की सुरक्षा सुनिश्चित करना महत्वपूर्ण है. दरअसल, पैदल चलने वालों को दुर्घटनाओं का खतरा अधिक होता है. बीएमटीसी में लगभग 40 लाख दैनिक सवारियां हैं, इसलिए इसे अधिक प्राथमिकता मिलनी चाहिए. शहर की गतिशीलता योजना में विभिन्न एजेंसियां ​​शामिल हैं. उन्होंने तकनीकी कंपनियों को इन्फेंट्री रोड पर यातायात प्रबंधन केंद्र का दौरा करने के लिए भी आमंत्रित किया ताकि वे देख सकें कि वे शहर के यातायात का प्रबंधन कैसे करते हैं. दयानंद ने मनीकंट्रोल को बताया कि ओआरआरसीए और कंपनियों के साथ बातचीत प्रभावी रही. \"प्रमुख मुद्दा यातायात था, लेकिन हमने अपनी योजनाओं के बारे में भी बताया और उनके सुझाव मांगे. हम यातायात को कम करने के लिए विभिन्न पहलों पर भी काम कर रहे हैं।\". ओआरआरसीए टिप्पणी के लिए उपलब्ध नहीं था. 90% साइबर धोखाधड़ी मामलों में तकनीकी विशेषज्ञ पीड़ित हैं: पुलिस इस बीच, व्हाइटफील्ड डिवीजन के पुलिस उपायुक्त एस गिरीश ने कहा, \"90 प्रतिशत से अधिक साइबर धोखाधड़ी मामलों में तकनीकी पेशेवर पीड़ित हैं, जो अधिक जागरूकता की आवश्यकता पर जोर देता है।. हाल ही में एक तकनीकी विशेषज्ञ 1 रुपये की ठगी का शिकार हो गया. 5 करोड़ की साइबर धोखाधड़ी. धोखाधड़ी के उदाहरण, जैसे ओटीपी धोखाधड़ी, अंशकालिक नौकरी घोटाले, ऋण धोखाधड़ी और निवेश धोखाधड़ी, प्रचुर मात्रा में हैं. उन्होंने आगे खुलासा किया कि उन्हें तकनीकी गलियारे की कंपनियों से दोपहिया और लैपटॉप चोरी की कई शिकायतें मिलती हैं. 1996 और 2002 के बीच चरणों में निर्मित, शहर के एक महत्वपूर्ण हिस्से को घेरने वाले 60 किलोमीटर के ओआरआर का उद्देश्य तेज यात्रा के लिए प्रमुख राजमार्गों को जोड़ना और बेंगलुरु में भीड़भाड़ कम करना है।. हालाँकि, ORR का त्रुटिपूर्ण डिज़ाइन, समानांतर सड़कों की अनुपस्थिति के साथ मिलकर, इसका मतलब है कि एक ट्रक का ख़राब होना, पेड़ का गिरना, या जलभराव पूरे तकनीकी गलियारे को ठप कर सकता है।\n",

      "लगभग 29 वर्षों के बाद, टीवीएस समूह की कोई कंपनी आरंभिक सार्वजनिक पेशकश (आईपीओ) की ओर बढ़ रही है।. 7 अगस्त को, टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस ने घोषणा की कि उसका आईपीओ 10 अगस्त से 14 अगस्त तक बोली के लिए खुला रहेगा।. सूचीबद्ध होने वाली आखिरी टीवीएस समूह कंपनी 1994 में टीवीएस इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स थी. टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस ने 2004 में एक अलग कंपनी बनने से पहले टीवीएस लॉजिस्टिक्स नाम से समूह के एक हिस्से के रूप में परिचालन शुरू किया।. आज, टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस या टीवीएस एससीएस, एक वैश्विक सप्लाई चेन कंपनी के रूप में, दुनिया भर में फॉर्च्यून 500 कंपनियों को एंड-टू-एंड समाधान प्रदान करती है।. व्यवसाय को दो मुख्य घटकों में विभाजित किया गया है: एकीकृत आपूर्ति श्रृंखला समाधान और नेटवर्क समाधान. यह भी पढ़ें: टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस आईपीओ ने पहली बार 36% बुकिंग दर्ज की। इंटीग्रेटेड सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस के तहत, कंपनी सोर्सिंग और खरीद, एकीकृत परिवहन, उत्पाद प्रबंधन समाधान, लॉजिस्टिक्स ऑपरेशन सेंटर और इन-प्लांट लॉजिस्टिक्स जैसे तैयार के लिए प्रौद्योगिकी-आधारित समाधान प्रदान करती है। . नेटवर्क सॉल्यूशंस के तहत, यह दो प्रकार की सेवाएं प्रदान करता है: ग्लोबल फ्रेट सॉल्यूशंस और टाइम क्रिटिकल फाइनल माइल सॉल्यूशंस, जिसमें विभिन्न प्रकार की सेवाएं शामिल हैं जैसे कि स्पेयर पार्ट्स लॉजिस्टिक्स सेवाएं, रिटर्न, नवीनीकरण और इंजीनियरिंग सहायता और बी2बी व्यवसायों के लिए कूरियर सेवाएं, दोनों बड़े और . अनुवादित, इसका मतलब यह है कि, एक विनिर्माण कंपनी को, अपने आपूर्तिकर्ताओं और ग्राहकों को पहचानने के बाद, इस बात की चिंता करने की ज़रूरत नहीं है कि चीजों को कैसे आगे बढ़ाया जाए. \"यह पूरे परिचालन को टीवीएस आपूर्ति श्रृंखला को आउटसोर्स कर सकता है, जो दुनिया में कहीं से भी कच्चा माल उठाएगा और उसे कंपनी के कारखानों में पहुंचाएगा, और तैयार माल उठाएगा और अपने ग्राहकों को वितरित करेगा, चाहे वह भारत में हो या . रास्ते में सभी काम, चाहे भंडारण हो या परिवहन के लिए कंटेनर बुक करना हो, या कस्टम क्लीयरेंस का ध्यान रखना हो, कंपनी हर चीज़ का ध्यान रखेगी. अब, हम जानते हैं कि सरकार के जोर और वैश्विक कंपनियों द्वारा चीन से परे अपने सोर्सिंग बेस में विविधता लाने के प्रयास के कारण, भारत में बड़े पैमाने पर निर्यात बढ़ने की संभावना है, जिसे व्यापक रूप से चीन-प्लस-वन रणनीति कहा जाता है।. इसका मतलब स्पष्ट रूप से टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन जैसी कंपनी के लिए अधिक व्यवसाय है. ठोस आधार पर विश्लेषकों का मानना ​​है कि कंपनी के पास एंड-टू-एंड आपूर्ति-श्रृंखला समाधान प्रदान करने की प्रतिस्पर्धी ताकत है. अब तक, कंपनी बड़े पैमाने पर अधिग्रहणों के माध्यम से बढ़ी है, पिछले 17 वर्षों में लगभग 16 अधिग्रहण हुए हैं. इस प्रकार, इसमें डोमेन विशेषज्ञता और वैश्विक उपस्थिति दोनों हैं, जिसका अर्थ है कि यह विभिन्न भौगोलिक क्षेत्रों और उद्योगों में काम करने वाले भविष्य के ग्राहकों के लिए जानकारी को दोहरा सकता है।. वर्तमान में, TVS SCS के ग्राहक यूरोप, एशिया (भारत सहित) और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के 26 देशों में हैं. एचडीएफसी सिक्योरिटीज की एक रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, एकीकृत, डेटा-संचालित, एंड-टू-एंड समाधानों के उपयोग के साथ, कंपनी ग्राहकों को मूल्य प्रदान करने और उनका विश्वास हासिल करने में सक्षम रही है।. इसका मतलब है कि बार-बार आने वाले ग्राहकों की उच्च दर है, जो मौजूदा ग्राहकों से व्यापार का स्थिर प्रवाह सुनिश्चित करती है, भले ही कंपनी नए ग्राहक जोड़ने पर ध्यान केंद्रित करती है।. \"हमारी माप की इकाई एक परियोजना या एक अनुबंध है; हमारे पास कितने अनुबंध हैं, इन अनुबंधों की दीर्घायु क्या है, और हमारी नवीनीकरण क्षमता क्या है... हमारी नवीनीकरण दर लगभग 99 प्रतिशत है, और यह हमारी क्षमता है . हाल ही में, इसने \"आपूर्ति श्रृंखला परिवर्तन\" के लिए यूके स्थित सेंट्रिका पीएलसी को अपने रोस्टर में जोड़ा।. अपने अधिकांश सौदों की तरह, टीवीएस ने 7 साल से अधिक के लिए सेंट्रिका सौदे पर हस्ताक्षर किए. विश्लेषकों का कहना है कि हालांकि टीवीएस के लिए कारोबार का अवसर बहुत बड़ा है और इसके कारोबार की प्रकृति के कारण इसके पास एक अनुकरणीय मॉडल है, लेकिन यह वैश्विक व्यापार में किसी भी प्रतिकूल स्थिति से अछूता नहीं रहेगा।. कोविड काल ने यही दिखाया. कोविड के दौरान, कंपनी का राजस्व मुश्किल से बढ़ा और कारोबार घाटे में चला गया. केवल FY23 में, यह 10,311 रुपये के लाभ के साथ हरे रंग में वापस आ सकता है. 01 करोड़. हालाँकि, बुरे समय में कंपनी के लिए जो चीज़ बचती है, वह तथ्य यह है कि उसके पास एक विविध पोर्टफोलियो है. किसी एक उद्योग या देश में किसी भी मंदी की भरपाई दूसरे उद्योग या देश की वृद्धि से हो सकती है. \"वैश्विक आपूर्ति शृंखला प्रभावित हुई और हमारे कई ग्राहक जैसे इलेक्ट्रॉनिक घटक और ऑटो निर्माता भी प्रभावित हुए. शुक्र है, हमारा पोर्टफोलियो काफी विविध है. इसलिए हम व्यवसाय को प्रभावी ढंग से प्रबंधित करने में सक्षम थे,\" यह कहा. वर्तमान में, टीवीएस एससीएस व्यवसाय का लगभग 50 प्रतिशत विनिर्माण से आता है; . गैर-ऑटो व्यवसायों में इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स, खनन, वैकल्पिक बिजली, प्रौद्योगिकी और उपभोक्ता सामान शामिल हैं, जबकि ऑटो के भीतर यह उत्पादन और उसके बाद के बाजारों दोनों का समर्थन करता है।. \"कई मायनों में, हमारा बिजनेस मॉडल जोखिम रहित है. युद्ध और मुद्रास्फीति के कारण पश्चिमी बाजारों में बहुत मजबूत आर्थिक प्रतिकूल परिस्थितियों के बावजूद, पिछले वित्त वर्ष में हमारा कारोबार बढ़ा,'' प्रबंधन ने हाल ही में मनीकंट्रोल को बताया. पूंजी तीव्रता पिछले तीन वित्तीय वर्षों में, जिसके वित्तीय विवरण उपलब्ध हैं, कंपनी को दो वर्षों में घाटा हुआ. पिछले वित्त वर्ष में इसने 41 रुपये का शुद्ध लाभ दर्ज किया था. 73 रुपये के नुकसान के मुकाबले 7 करोड़ रुपये. FY21 में 9 करोड़. FY23 के लिए EBIDTA मार्जिन 6 रहा. 68 प्रतिशत. 5 पर आरओई के साथ रिटर्न अनुपात भी अप्रभावी था. 50 प्रतिशत और आरओसीई 7 पर. 64 प्रतिशत. इस बिंदु पर वित्तीय आंकड़े बहुत लाभदायक व्यवसाय की ओर इशारा नहीं करते हैं, हालांकि प्रबंधन 'एसेट-लाइट' मॉडल का दावा करता है और कहता है कि वह अगले कुछ वर्षों में दोहरे अंक ईबीआईडीटीए के लिए प्रयास कर रहा है।. संपत्ति-कम होने का मतलब है कि कंपनी के पास अपने किसी भी बेड़े, कंटेनर या गोदाम की जगह नहीं है, यह सब बहुत अच्छा है क्योंकि इसका मतलब है कि व्यवसाय के लिए पूंजी की आवश्यकता बहुत अधिक नहीं है. यह गोदामों और वाहनों को पट्टे पर देता है और क्षमता और बेड़े पर नियंत्रण का पूरा नियंत्रण रखता है. माल की शेड्यूलिंग, रूटिंग, भंडारण और डिलीवरी का प्रबंधन कंपनी द्वारा किया जाता है, जो इसे ग्राहकों की आवश्यकताओं के अनुरूप चीजों को लचीला रखते हुए परिचालन गुणवत्ता मेट्रिक्स पर नियंत्रण बनाए रखने में सक्षम बनाता है।. फिर भी, एसेट-लाइट मॉडल को काफी हद तक एक अच्छे मॉडल के रूप में देखा जाता है, एचडीएफसी सिक्योरिटीज की रिपोर्ट में कहा गया है कि वेयरहाउसिंग और परिवर्तन के लिए तीसरे पक्ष और नेटवर्क भागीदारों पर कंपनी की उच्च निर्भरता, संचालन, वित्तीय और नकदी प्रवाह को प्रभावित कर सकती है।. इसके अलावा, कंपनी का माल ढुलाई, समाशोधन, अग्रेषण और हैंडलिंग शुल्क, और जनशक्ति व्यय (कर्मचारी लाभ व्यय, उप-अनुबंध लागत और आकस्मिक श्रम शुल्क शामिल) इसके परिचालन व्यय का एक महत्वपूर्ण हिस्सा बनाते हैं, जिसका अर्थ है किसी भी आंतरिक या बाहरी कारण से कोई भी वृद्धि . हालाँकि इन्हें आम तौर पर ग्राहकों तक पहुँचाया जाता है, यह हमेशा संभव नहीं हो सकता है, और यह इस पर निर्भर करता है कि अनुबंध में क्या प्रावधान है. एचडीएफसी सिक्योरिटीज द्वारा बताई गई एक और चुनौती विदेशी मुद्रा में इसका एक्सपोजर है. विदेशी मुद्रा में उतार-चढ़ाव से इसके राजस्व और उधार दोनों पर असर पड़ सकता है. भारत में अवसर जबकि इसकी अधिकांश उपस्थिति अंतरराष्ट्रीय है, भारत में बढ़ते आपूर्ति श्रृंखला बाजार और इसके आकार के बड़े पैमाने के खिलाड़ी की अनुपस्थिति घरेलू बाजार में टीवीएस एससीएस के लिए फायदेमंद हो सकती है, और अधिकांश विश्लेषकों का मानना ​​​​है कि यही कारण है . वर्तमान में, भारत में थर्ड-पार्टी लॉजिस्टिक्स बाज़ार का एक बड़ा हिस्सा अत्यधिक अव्यवस्थित है. फिस्डोम के अनुसंधान प्रमुख, नीरव करकेरा ने कहा, \"टीवीएस एससीएस के पास बड़े संस्थागत ग्राहकों, पैमाने और विस्तार की बढ़त है और एंड-टू-एंड समाधान प्रदान करने की क्षमता है जो कोई अन्य कंपनी नहीं करती है।\". इसके निश्चित रूप से अपने फायदे हैं, जिसमें आपूर्ति श्रृंखला प्रक्रिया में विभिन्न बिंदुओं पर तालमेल बनाने में आसानी भी शामिल है. \"वास्तव में, भारत में लॉजिस्टिक्स उद्योग अनुकूल व्यापक आर्थिक कारकों, भारतीय लॉजिस्टिक्स क्षेत्र में आउटसोर्सिंग की वृद्धि और विनिर्माण और खपत को प्रोत्साहित करने वाली सरकारी नीतियों जैसे वित्त वर्ष 2022 से 13 प्रतिशत की सीएजीआर पर वित्त वर्ष 2027 तक 385 बिलियन डॉलर तक बढ़ने की उम्मीद है। . पिछले कुछ वर्षों में, वैश्विक कंपनियों की चीन प्लस वन रणनीति के आधार पर, सरकार घरेलू विनिर्माण को प्रोत्साहित कर रही है. विश्लेषकों का मानना ​​है कि यह इस क्षेत्र के लिए अतिरिक्त लाभ हो सकता है. फोकस में आईपीओ टीवीएस एससीएस ने शुरुआत में पिछले साल आईपीओ लाने के अपने इरादे की घोषणा की थी, लेकिन यह बताया गया कि बाजार की स्थितियों और निवेशकों की भावनाओं को ध्यान में रखते हुए इसे स्थगित कर दिया गया था।. आईपीओ के माध्यम से, कंपनी, जिसका मूल्य 9,200 करोड़ रुपये है, पहले से तय किए गए 2,000 करोड़ रुपये के मुकाबले नए इश्यू से लगभग 600 करोड़ रुपये जुटाने की योजना बना रही है।. कंपनी के अनुसार, जुटाई गई धनराशि कर्ज से जुड़ी पिछली चुनौतियों से उबरने में मदद करने में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाएगी. इसी तरह, उसने अपनी बिक्री पेशकश को घटाकर 14 कर दिया है. पहले नियोजित 59 मिलियन शेयरों में से 23 मिलियन शेयर. इसकी आरंभिक सार्वजनिक पेशकश के लिए निर्धारित मूल्य दायरा 187-197 रुपये है. निर्गम मूल्य के उच्च अंत पर, कंपनी का बाजार पूंजीकरण 8,750 करोड़ रुपये है. इश्यू की कीमत 10 है. 18 रुपये के शुद्ध संपत्ति मूल्य के आधार पर 5 गुना. मार्च 2023 तक 89. टीवीएस समूह, जिसे एक शेयरधारक-अनुकूल समूह के रूप में देखा जाता है, और जबरदस्त विकास के अवसर के साथ कंपनी की वंशावली को ध्यान में रखते हुए, स्टॉक में विकास की लहर पर चढ़ने और लंबी अवधि में धन बनाने की क्षमता है।. लेकिन अल्प से मध्यम अवधि में, यह कोई बढ़िया दांव नहीं हो सकता है. करकेरा का कहना है कि उन्हें बड़े संस्थागत निवेशकों के बीच इस स्टॉक के लिए अच्छी संभावनाएं दिखती हैं. उन्होंने कहा, \"यह क्षेत्र बहुत अधिक संस्थागत हित की गारंटी देता है और ये निवेशक इस क्षेत्र पर दीर्घकालिक जोखिम लेने को तैयार हैं जो विस्तार मोड में है।\"\n",

. \"हम वैश्विक गेमिंग और प्रौद्योगिकी उद्योग में एक प्रमुख खिलाड़ी के रूप में भारत की क्षमता में दृढ़ता से विश्वास करते हैं. हम न केवल गेमिंग और तकनीकी उद्योग में बल्कि व्यापक सामग्री परिदृश्य में भी परिवर्तनकारी प्रभाव डालने के लिए समर्पित हैं\" सोहन ने कहा. उन्होंने कहा कि क्राफ्टन का इरादा 150 मिलियन डॉलर के कोष में से कम से कम एक तिहाई मौजूदा कंपनियों को उनकी भविष्य की विकास पहल के लिए आवंटित करने का है, और एक तिहाई गहरी तकनीकी कंपनियों को आवंटित करने का है जो उपभोक्ताओं को अलग सेवाएं और पेशकश प्रदान कर सकें।. उन्होंने कहा, शेष एक-तिहाई अन्य नए स्टार्टअप की ओर जाएगा. \"हम विकास चरण के निवेशक के रूप में उतने परिपक्व नहीं हैं, लेकिन शुरुआती चरण के निवेशक के रूप में भी नहीं. हम खुद को इस तरह के क्षेत्र में स्थापित कर रहे हैं जहां स्टार्टअप ने उत्पाद बाजार में फिट साबित कर दिया है, और राजस्व में बढ़ोतरी शुरू हो गई है, लेकिन विकास को गति देने के लिए उन्हें बड़े पैमाने पर फंडिंग की जरूरत है\" सोहन ने कहा. उन्होंने कहा, उन्होंने बताया कि वे नए सौदों को लेकर चयनात्मक हैं क्योंकि वे संस्थापकों के साथ संबंध रखना पसंद करते हैं और किसी कंपनी में निष्क्रिय निवेशक नहीं हैं।. उन्होंने कहा, \"हम आम तौर पर कंपनी में कम से कम 10% हिस्सेदारी रखना पसंद करते हैं और फिर हम बोर्ड में बैठना चाहते हैं, हम उन्हें सलाह देने और नए व्यवसाय विकास के अवसरों को पेश करने के मामले में अधिक सक्रिय होना चाहते हैं।\". क्राफ्टन, जो पहले से ही लुमिकाई और 3one4 कैपिटल जैसे शुरुआती चरण के उद्यम पूंजी फंड में निवेश कर चुका है, वर्तमान में देश में इसी तरह के वीसी फंड निवेश के अवसरों की तलाश कर रहा है, सोहन ने कहा. इस सप्ताह की शुरुआत में, जापानी मोबाइल मनोरंजन दिग्गज मिक्सी ने भारत के बाजार को समर्पित 50 मिलियन डॉलर का कॉर्पोरेट उद्यम पूंजी कोष भी लॉन्च किया. यह फंड देश में गेमिंग, डिजिटल मनोरंजन और उपभोक्ता सेवा क्षेत्र में शुरुआती चरण के स्टार्टअप को समर्थन देगा. इस बीच, लुमिकाई ने देश में शुरुआती चरण के गेमिंग और इंटरैक्टिव मीडिया स्टार्टअप को समर्थन देने के लिए $50 मिलियन जुटाने के उद्देश्य से जून 2023 में अपना दूसरा फंड लॉन्च किया।. इसने घरेलू रुपया पूंजी को आकर्षित करने के लिए भारतीय सीमित भागीदारों के लिए एक समर्पित 10 मिलियन डॉलर का एआईएफ (वैकल्पिक निवेश कोष) भी स्थापित किया।. इससे लुमिकाई की कुल प्रबंधनाधीन संपत्ति (एयूएम) 100 मिलियन डॉलर हो जाएगी. यह भी पढ़ें | . महाद्वीप में वीडियो गेम, ई-स्पोर्ट्स और स्ट्रीमिंग को कवर करने वाली मार्केट रिसर्च और कंसल्टिंग फर्म निको पार्टनर्स के अनुसार, 2022 में 5 मिलियन. यह 21 की पांच साल की चक्रवृद्धि वार्षिक वृद्धि दर से बढ़ने के लिए तैयार है. $1 को छूने के लिए 1 प्रतिशत. 2026 में 4 बिलियन. इसमें वास्तविक धन खेलों से उत्पन्न राजस्व शामिल नहीं है. फर्म ने कहा कि भारत में लगभग 34 प्रतिशत गेमर्स ने 2022 में गैर-आरएमजी टाइटल पर पैसा खर्च किया।. भारत के समग्र गेमिंग उद्योग का राजस्व वित्त वर्ष 2011 में 2 बिलियन डॉलर से बढ़कर 2 डॉलर हो गया. वित्त वर्ष 2012 में 6 बिलियन और 27 प्रतिशत की चक्रवृद्धि वार्षिक वृद्धि दर से $8 तक बढ़ने की उम्मीद है. लुमिकाई की एक रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, FY27 में 6 बिलियन. भारत के वीडियो गेमिंग बाजार का एक त्वरित स्नैपशॉट, भारत के गेम्स पोर्टफोलियो का विस्तार क्राफ्टन ने हाल ही में डिफेंस डर्बी के लॉन्च के साथ देश में गेम्स के अपने पोर्टफोलियो का विस्तार किया, जो कि उसके स्वतंत्र स्टूडियो राइजिंगविंग्स द्वारा विकसित एक वास्तविक समय रणनीति गेम है।. इस लॉन्च के साथ, क्राफ्टन अब भारत में चार टाइटल पेश करता है जिसमें बीजीएमआई के अलावा एक वास्तविक समय रणनीति गेम रोड टू वेलोर: एम्पायर और एक बैटल रॉयल गेम न्यू स्टेट मोबाइल शामिल है।. \"जो मेट्रिक्स हम भारतीय गेमर्स से देख रहे हैं, वे वैश्विक गेमर्स से बहुत अलग हैं. यह एक कठिन यात्रा है\" सोहन ने कहा. उदाहरण के लिए, सोहन ने कहा कि कुछ गेम जिन्होंने अन्य बाजारों में काफी अच्छा काम किया है, जरूरी नहीं कि वे भारत में भी उसी तरह काम करें।. \"मुझे लगता है कि भारतीय लोग थोड़े रूढ़िवादी हैं या नए गेमप्ले या नई शैली से कम परिचित हैं. मेरी विनम्र राय में, भारतीय लोग अपना अधिकांश गेमिंग समय लूडो या किसी प्रकार के कार्ड और बोर्ड गेम और बीजीएमआई या अन्य बैटल रॉयल गेम्स में बिताते हैं।. ये गेम यहां लोगों के गेमिंग समय का 50 प्रतिशत से अधिक खर्च कर सकते हैं. लेकिन मेरा मानना ​​है कि रणनीति गेम, रेसिंग गेम में बहुत संभावनाएं हैं\" हालांकि वे एक वैश्विक गेमिंग कंपनी हैं, सोहन ने कहा कि उनका इरादा एक स्थानीय प्रकाशक बनने का है जो \"भारत से वैश्विक गेम या नए गेम ला सके जो गेमर्स के लिए आंखें खोल सकें. यह रातोरात काम नहीं कर सकता लेकिन हम सीखना जारी रखेंगे\"\n",

      "औसत दीर्घकालिक यू. एस. इस सप्ताह बंधक दर बढ़कर 7% से कम हो गई है, जो भावी घर खरीदने वालों के लिए नवीनतम झटका है, जो बिक्री के लिए घरों की कमी से सीमित आवास बाजार के कारण पहले से ही किफायती चुनौतियों का सामना कर रहे हैं।. बंधक खरीदार फ्रेडी मैक ने गुरुवार को कहा कि बेंचमार्क 30-वर्षीय गृह ऋण पर औसत दर बढ़कर 6 हो गई है. 6 से 96%. पिछले सप्ताह 90%. एक साल पहले यह दर औसतन 5 थी. 22%. यह औसत दर में लगातार तीसरी साप्ताहिक वृद्धि है, जो अब 13 जुलाई को निर्धारित वर्ष के उच्चतम स्तर से मेल खाती है. उच्च दरें उधारकर्ताओं के लिए प्रति माह सैकड़ों डॉलर की लागत जोड़ सकती हैं, जिससे यह सीमित हो जाएगा कि वे उस बाजार में कितना खर्च कर सकते हैं जो पहले से ही कई अमेरिकियों के लिए अप्राप्य है।. फ्रेडी मैक के मुख्य अर्थशास्त्री सैम खातेर ने कहा, \"इसमें कोई संदेह नहीं है कि उच्च दरें जारी रहने से सामर्थ्य की चुनौतियां अपेक्षा से अधिक लंबी हो जाएंगी, खासकर घर की कीमतें फिर से बढ़ रही हैं।\". \"हालांकि, दरों पर ऊपर की ओर दबाव कम बेरोजगारी और मजबूत वेतन वृद्धि के साथ एक लचीली अर्थव्यवस्था का उत्पाद है, जिसने ऐतिहासिक रूप से खरीद मांग को ठोस बनाए रखा है. \"30-वर्षीय बंधक पर औसत दर दो साल पहले की तुलना में दोगुनी से अधिक बनी हुई है, जब यह केवल 2 थी. 87%. उन बेहद कम दरों ने घर की बिक्री और पुनर्वित्त की लहर को प्रेरित किया. तेजी से ऊंची दरें अब उपलब्ध घरों की कमी में योगदान दे रही हैं, क्योंकि घर के मालिक जिन्होंने दो साल पहले उधार लेने की लागत कम कर दी थी, अब बेचने के लिए अनिच्छुक हैं और नई संपत्ति पर ऊंची दर लगा रहे हैं।. आवास आपूर्ति की कमी भी एक बड़ा कारण है कि इस वर्ष की पहली छमाही में घरों की बिक्री 23% कम हो गई है. दरों में नवीनतम वृद्धि 10-वर्षीय ट्रेजरी उपज में बढ़ोतरी के बाद हुई है, जो बढ़कर 4 हो गई है. पिछले सप्ताह 19%, नवंबर की शुरुआत के बाद से यह उच्चतम स्तर है. उपज, जिसका उपयोग ऋणदाता बंधक और अन्य ऋणों पर मूल्य दरों के लिए करते हैं, 4 पर थी. गुरुवार दोपहर के कारोबार में 02%. उच्च मुद्रास्फीति ने फेडरल रिजर्व को मार्च 2022 के बाद से अपनी बेंचमार्क ब्याज दर को 11 बार बढ़ाने के लिए प्रेरित किया, जिससे फेड फंड दर 22 वर्षों में उच्चतम स्तर पर पहुंच गई।. पिछली गर्मियों से मुद्रास्फीति लगातार कम हुई है, और कई विश्लेषकों का मानना ​​है कि फेड अपनी दर वृद्धि के अंत तक पहुँच गया है. बंधक दरें आवश्यक रूप से फेड की दर में वृद्धि को प्रतिबिंबित नहीं करती हैं, लेकिन 10-वर्षीय ट्रेजरी नोट पर उपज को ट्रैक करती हैं. भविष्य की मुद्रास्फीति के लिए निवेशकों की उम्मीदें, यू.एस. की वैश्विक मांग. एस. राजकोष और फेड ब्याज दरों के साथ जो करता है वह गृह ऋण पर दरों को प्रभावित कर सकता है. अपने घरों को पुनर्वित्त करने वालों के बीच लोकप्रिय 15-वर्षीय निश्चित दर बंधक पर औसत दर बढ़कर 6 हो गई. 6 से 34%. पिछले सप्ताह 25%. एक साल पहले इसका औसत 4 था. 59%, फ्रेडी मैक ने कहा\n",

      "बैंकरों का कहना है कि आरबीआई के आई-सीआरआर से बैंकों के लिए तरलता की कोई कमी नहीं होगी\n",
      "बैंकरों ने 10 अगस्त को मनीकंट्रोल को बताया कि भारतीय रिज़र्व बैंक (RBI) की वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (I-CRR) की घोषणा से बैंकिंग उद्योग के लिए तरलता की कोई कमी पैदा होने की संभावना नहीं है, जो बदले में ऋण देने की प्रक्रिया में बाधा बन सकती है।. उन्होंने कहा कि बैंकरों को नीति-पश्चात् प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस के दौरान आरबीआई गवर्नर शक्तिकांत दास के आश्वासन से राहत मिल रही है कि केंद्रीय बैंक तरलता प्रबंधन के प्रति सक्रिय रहेगा और दोनों पक्षों पर कार्य करेगा।. \"ऋण के लिए तरलता की उपलब्धता है. यूको बैंक के प्रबंध निदेशक (एमडी) और मुख्य कार्यकारी अधिकारी (सीईओ) अश्विनी कुमार ने कहा, \"मुझे नहीं लगता कि इसका कोई प्रभाव पड़ेगा क्योंकि बैंकों के पास पर्याप्त तरलता उपलब्ध है।\". इससे पहले आज, केंद्रीय बैंक ने कहा कि अनुसूचित वाणिज्यिक बैंकों को 19 मई, 2023 और 28 जुलाई के बीच अपनी शुद्ध मांग और समय देनदारियों (एनडीटीएल) में वृद्धि पर 10 प्रतिशत का वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (आई-सीआरआर) बनाए रखना होगा। . बैंकिंग प्रणाली में 2,000 रुपये के नोटों की वापसी के बाद अर्थव्यवस्था में बढ़ी अधिशेष तरलता के प्रबंधन के उद्देश्य से इसकी घोषणा की गई थी।. 19 मई को, RBI ने 2,000 रुपये के नोट को वापस लेने की घोषणा की, जिससे नागरिकों को या तो नोट बदलने या अपने खातों में जमा करने की अनुमति मिल गई।. 1 अगस्त को केंद्रीय बैंक ने कहा कि 3 रु. 31 जुलाई तक 14 लाख करोड़ मूल्य के 2,000 रुपये के बैंकनोट या 88 प्रतिशत प्रचलन में थे, बैंकिंग प्रणाली में वापस आ गए थे।. हालांकि, कुछ बैंकर्स का कहना है कि अगर लिक्विडिटी कंट्रोल में नहीं रही तो आरबीआई इस अवधि को बढ़ा सकता है. \"हम इसे एक अस्थायी उपाय के रूप में देख रहे हैं, और हमें उम्मीद है कि यह वैसा ही रहेगा. यदि केंद्रीय बैंक द्वारा बताई गई निर्धारित अवधि में तरलता प्रणाली नियंत्रण में नहीं है, तो हम केंद्रीय बैंक से आई-सीआरआर लगाने की अवधि बढ़ाने की उम्मीद कर सकते हैं,'' कोटक महिंद्रा बैंक के ग्लोबल ट्रांजेक्शन बैंकिंग के अध्यक्ष शेखर भंडारी ने कहा।. कमाई के मोर्चे पर, कुमार ने कहा कि बैंक की कमाई पर बहुत कम प्रभाव पड़ेगा. अपने संबोधन में, गवर्नर दास ने इस बात पर प्रकाश डाला कि केंद्रीय बैंक ने वित्तीय और मूल्य स्थिरता के हित में आई-सीआरआर लगाने को वांछनीय माना है और बैंकों के पास अपने ऋण देने के संचालन के लिए पर्याप्त तरलता होगी।. \"तरलता की अधिकता की पृष्ठभूमि में वृद्धिशील सीआरआर को आवश्यक माना गया था. हमने इसे वित्तीय और मूल्य स्थिरता के हित में वांछनीय माना. इसका असर महंगाई पर भी पड़ेगा. दास ने कहा, ''यह पूरी तरह से अस्थायी उपाय है।''. दरों पर कोई असर नहीं आईडीबीआई बैंक के उप प्रबंध निदेशक सुरेश खटनहार ने कहा कि नीति की घोषणा के बाद बैंक अपनी जमा या उधार दरों में कोई बदलाव नहीं कर सकते हैं।. 10 अगस्त को, मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) ने सर्वसम्मति से रेपो दर को 6 पर अपरिवर्तित छोड़ने के लिए मतदान किया. 5 प्रतिशत, गवर्नर दास ने आज घोषणा की. स्थायी जमा सुविधा दर को भी 6 पर बरकरार रखा गया है. 25 प्रतिशत. साथ ही, सीमांत स्थायी सुविधा दर और बैंक दर दोनों को 6 पर बरकरार रखा गया है. 75 प्रतिशत. अश्विनी कुमार ने कहा, ''हम उम्मीद कर रहे थे कि रेपो रेट में ठहराव जारी रहेगा।''. मार्जिनल कॉस्ट ऑफ फंड्स-आधारित लेंडिंग रेट (एमसीएलआर) के नजरिए से ब्याज दरों में स्थिरता है. उन्होंने कहा, एक या दो बकेट के भीतर कुछ बैंड में ब्याज दरों में कुछ बढ़ोतरी देखी जा सकती है. आरबीआई ने चालू वित्त वर्ष में लगातार तीसरी बार ब्याज दरें अपरिवर्तित रखीं. यूपीआई लाइट की लेनदेन सीमा 200 रुपये से बढ़ाकर 500 रुपये करने के आरबीआई के फैसले पर बैंकरों ने कहा कि इस कदम से डिजिटलीकरण बढ़ेगा. सितंबर 2022 में नेशनल पेमेंट्स कॉरपोरेशन ऑफ इंडिया (एनपीसीआई) द्वारा लॉन्च किया गया, यूपीआई लाइट बैंकों के प्रसंस्करण संसाधनों को अनुकूलित करके त्वरित छोटे मूल्य के लेनदेन की अनुमति देता है, जिससे लेनदेन विफलताएं कम होती हैं।. यह उपयोगकर्ताओं को पिन कोड की आवश्यकता के बिना प्रतिदिन 200 रुपये तक का लेनदेन करने की अनुमति देता है, जिससे लेनदेन का समय कम हो गया है।. जबकि लेनदेन की सीमा अब 500 रुपये तक बढ़ा दी गई है, दो-कारक प्रमाणीकरण की छूट से जुड़े जोखिमों को रोकने के लिए यूपीआई लाइट बैलेंस सीमा को 2,000 रुपये पर अपरिवर्तित छोड़ दिया गया है।. यूपीआई लाइट पेटीएम पर उपलब्ध है.

      "भारतीय रिजर्व बैंक (RBI) ने 10 अगस्त को कहा कि अनुसूचित बैंकों को 19 मई से 28 जुलाई के बीच अपनी शुद्ध मांग और समय देनदारियों (NDTL) में वृद्धि पर 10 प्रतिशत का वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (I-CRR) बनाए रखना होगा।. केंद्रीय बैंक ने कहा कि मौजूदा नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (सीआरआर) 4 पर अपरिवर्तित रहेगा. 5 प्रतिशत. तो, यह I-CRR क्यों? . आई-सीआरआर और सीआरआर के बीच अंतर आई-सीआरआर सीआरआर के समान है, जिसमें बैंकों को अपने पैसे का एक निश्चित हिस्सा आरबीआई के पास अलग रखना पड़ता है।. इस पर उन्हें कोई ब्याज नहीं मिलता. इसी तरह, आई-सीआरआर के साथ, बैंकों को 19 मई से 28 जुलाई के बीच अर्जित एनडीटीएल का अतिरिक्त 10 प्रतिशत अलग रखना होगा।. RBI ने I-CRR की घोषणा क्यों की है? . आरबीआई गवर्नर शक्तिकांत दास ने मौद्रिक नीति समिति की बैठक के बाद प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में कहा, \"इस उपाय का उद्देश्य बैंकिंग प्रणाली में 2,000 रुपये के नोटों की वापसी सहित विभिन्न कारकों से उत्पन्न अधिशेष तरलता को अवशोषित करना है।\". पिछले कुछ महीनों में, 2,000 रुपये के बैंक नोटों की वापसी, आरबीआई के अधिशेष को सरकार को हस्तांतरित करने, सरकारी खर्च में बढ़ोतरी और पूंजी प्रवाह के बाद बैंकिंग प्रणाली में तरलता तेजी से बढ़ी है।. इसे कम करने के लिए, केंद्रीय बैंक ने अलग-अलग अवधि की विभिन्न परिवर्तनीय दर रिवर्स रेपो (वीआरआरआर) नीलामियां आयोजित की हैं, लेकिन बैंकों से धीमी प्रतिक्रिया मिली, क्योंकि उन्होंने सीमांत स्थायी सुविधा के तहत बाद में धन मांगने से बचने के लिए तरलता को बनाए रखना पसंद किया। . एमएसएफ बैंकों को आपात स्थिति में रेपो से अधिक दर पर आरबीआई से उधार लेने की अनुमति देता है. जून के बाद से, केंद्रीय बैंक ने 18 लाख करोड़ रुपये के लिए 16 वीआरआरआर नीलामी आयोजित की है. हालाँकि, बैंकों ने इन नीलामियों में केवल 7,73,023 करोड़ रुपये लगाए. I-CRR में कितना पैसा जमा होगा? . 11 लाख करोड़. एनएमआईएमएस सरला अनिल मोदी स्कूल ऑफ इकोनॉमिक्स की एसोसिएट प्रोफेसर ईशा खन्ना के अनुसार, इस कदम से अल्पावधि में तरलता की स्थिति थोड़ी सख्त हो सकती है और अल्पकालिक कॉल दरें प्रभावित हो सकती हैं।. इसका प्रणालीगत तरलता पर क्या प्रभाव पड़ेगा? . \"10 प्रतिशत का आईसीआरआर बैंकिंग प्रणाली से 1 लाख करोड़ रुपये से थोड़ा अधिक निकाल सकता है. इसके बावजूद, अगले 1-2 महीनों के लिए सिस्टम में तरलता 1 लाख करोड़ रुपये से अधिक अधिशेष में रहेगी, ”पंकज पाठक, फंड मैनेजर-फिक्स्ड इनकम, क्वांटम एएमसी ने कहा।. लेकिन आई-सीआरआर अल्पकालिक दरों को प्रभावित करेगा, जो 15-20 आधार अंक (बीपीएस) तक कठोर हो सकता है।. सह-समूह प्रमुख - वित्तीय, वरिष्ठ उपाध्यक्ष, अनिल गुप्ता ने कहा, \"हमें उम्मीद है कि निकट अवधि में ट्रेजरी बिल, कॉल मनी दरें और वाणिज्यिक पत्र जैसे मुद्रा बाजार उपकरणों की अल्पकालिक दरों में 15-20 बीपीएस की वृद्धि होगी।\" . क्या इसका उधार और जमा दरों पर असर पड़ेगा? . दास ने सम्मेलन के दौरान कहा, \"हम यह सुनिश्चित करेंगे कि बैंकों के लिए ऋण देना जारी रखने के लिए प्रणाली में पर्याप्त तरलता हो।\". क्या आरबीआई वीआरआरआर नीलामी जारी रखेगा? . दास ने कहा, \"वीआरआरआर (नीलामी) जारी रहेगी।\" उन्होंने कहा कि वीआरआरआर प्रणाली 10 अगस्त को लगभग 93,000 करोड़ रुपये जारी करेगी।\n",

      "इंजीनियरिंग पाठ्यक्रम, जिनकी एक समय भारत में छात्रों द्वारा अत्यधिक मांग थी, अब अपना आकर्षण खोते जा रहे हैं. देश में इंजीनियरिंग और प्रौद्योगिकी पाठ्यक्रमों में दाखिला लेने वाले छात्रों की संख्या में हाल के वर्षों में लगातार गिरावट देखी गई है, जो घटकर 39 रह गई है।. 2020-21 में 45 से बढ़कर 2 लाख. आधिकारिक आंकड़ों के मुताबिक, 2014-15 में 4 लाख. शिक्षा मंत्रालय द्वारा प्रकाशित उच्च शिक्षा पर अखिल भारतीय सर्वेक्षण (एआईएसएचई) का डेटा इस मामले पर पूछे गए एक प्रश्न के उत्तर में शिक्षा राज्य मंत्री सुभाष सरकार द्वारा संसद में साझा किया गया था।. अखिल भारतीय तकनीकी शिक्षा परिषद से मिली जानकारी का हवाला देते हुए उन्होंने कहा, \"2011-12 से 2020-21 तक नामांकन में मामूली गिरावट का कारण छात्रों की प्राथमिकताओं में बदलाव और वैकल्पिक नौकरी के अवसरों वाले नए पाठ्यक्रमों की शुरूआत हो सकती है।\" . एआईएसएचई के डेटा से पता चलता है कि स्नातक स्तर पर बैचलर ऑफ इंजीनियरिंग (बीई) और बैचलर ऑफ टेक्नोलॉजी (बीटेक) एकमात्र प्रमुख कार्यक्रम हैं जिनमें नामांकन में गिरावट देखी गई है।. जैसे-जैसे नामांकन की संख्या में गिरावट आई है, इंजीनियरिंग पाठ्यक्रम प्रदान करने वाले कॉलेजों की संख्या में भी कमी आई है, जिनमें से कई हाल के वर्षों में बंद हो गए हैं. एआईसीटीई द्वारा अनुमोदित तकनीकी और इंजीनियरिंग कॉलेजों की संख्या में 9 की गिरावट आई है. 2017-18 से 2023-24 के बीच 02 फीसदी. रोजगार की कमी इंडिया स्किल रिपोर्ट 2022 के आंकड़ों के अनुसार, भारत के लगभग आधे इंजीनियरिंग स्नातक रोजगार के योग्य नहीं हैं. 2022 में बीई या बीटेक पाठ्यक्रम पूरा करने वाली रोजगार योग्य प्रतिभा का प्रतिशत सिर्फ 55 प्रतिशत था. इस बीच, विश्व आर्थिक मंच (डब्ल्यूईएफ) के अनुमान से पता चलता है कि देश के पांच इंजीनियरिंग स्नातकों में से केवल एक ही रोजगार के योग्य है।. इसके अलावा, नीति आयोग के पूर्व उपाध्यक्ष राजीव कुमार के एक बयान के अनुसार, भारत के 48 प्रतिशत इंजीनियरिंग स्नातक बेरोजगार हैं।. उपयुक्त नौकरियों की कमी एस्पायरिंग माइंड्स (जिसे अब एसएचएल कहा जाता है) की एक रिपोर्ट से पता चलता है कि भारत में अधिकांश इंजीनियरिंग स्नातकों के लिए, आवेदन करने के लिए सही कंपनी या प्रोफ़ाइल ढूंढना रोजगार पाने में सबसे बड़ी चुनौती है, इसके बाद साक्षात्कार में सफल होना पड़ता है।. हालाँकि लगभग 95 प्रतिशत छात्रों ने अपनी रोजगार क्षमता में सुधार के लिए किसी न किसी प्रकार का प्रशिक्षण लिया है, लेकिन अधिकांश ने कॉलेज में ही ऐसा किया है. अधिक चिंताजनक बात यह है कि सर्वेक्षण में शामिल 59 प्रतिशत छात्रों ने कहा कि संकाय सदस्य उनसे पाठ्यक्रम में शामिल अवधारणाओं के उद्योग अनुप्रयोगों के बारे में बात नहीं करते हैं।. ऐसा लगता है कि आवेदन करने के लिए सही नौकरियां ढूंढने में कठिनाई आईआईटी जैसे प्रमुख संस्थानों तक भी बढ़ रही है. आईआईटी बॉम्बे में सेंटर फॉर पॉलिसी स्टडीज के एक अध्ययन के अनुसार, 2014 और 2018 के बीच, संस्थान से लगभग 60 प्रतिशत स्नातकों ने गैर-प्रमुख नौकरियां लीं, जो उनके अध्ययन की शाखा के अलावा अन्य क्षेत्रों में नौकरियों को संदर्भित करता है।. कंप्यूटर विज्ञान और इंजीनियरिंग तथा इलेक्ट्रिकल इंजीनियरिंग को छोड़कर सभी शाखाओं के अधिकांश छात्रों ने गैर-प्रमुख नौकरियों के लिए अधिक प्राथमिकता दिखाई\n",

      "कुछ अपवादों को छोड़कर, सबसे प्रमुख केंद्रीय बैंक ब्याज दरें किस दिशा में जा रही हैं, इसका विस्तृत अनुमान प्रदान करने के व्यवसाय से सेवानिवृत्त हो गए हैं. चिंताजनक मुद्रास्फीति के युग में गलत होने की कीमत बहुत अधिक थी. जापान कुछ नया करने की कोशिश कर रहा है: फॉरवर्ड मिसगाइडेंस. बैंक ऑफ जापान ने पिछले एक दशक में जो विकल्प चुने हैं उनमें बग की बजाय परेशान करने वाले आश्चर्य शामिल हैं. अति-लूज़ पैसे और इसका समर्थन करने वाले साजो-सामान को ख़त्म करने का मतलब है कि हाल ही में वैश्विक बाज़ारों को हिलाकर रख देने वाली संचार दुर्घटनाएँ अवश्य घटित होंगी।. यदि वे वास्तव में एक दुर्घटना थे. निवेशकों को कम आसान पैसे की राह पर अधिक रोमांच के लिए तैयार रहना चाहिए. मुद्रास्फीति अब ज़मीन से नीचे आ गई है - इस बारे में तर्क हैं कि कीमतों में कितनी गति है - वांछित गंतव्य संभवतः सरकारी बांडों पर पैदावार की जोरदार पुलिसिंग का अंत है. और संभवतः, नकारात्मक आधिकारिक दरों का अंत हो जाएगा. यह रातोरात नहीं होगा, लेकिन एक सम्मानजनक निकास की संभावनाएं लंबी हैं. बीओजे नीति में बदलावों के प्रति बाजार की संवेदनशीलता अत्यधिक है क्योंकि अधिकारी अपने दृष्टिकोण की दिशा में मार्गदर्शन करने के बजाय सीधे प्रतिभूतियों के मूल्य का प्रबंधन करना चाहते हैं।. कुछ बीओजे पर्यवेक्षकों ने भविष्यवाणी की कि गवर्नर काज़ुओ उएदा 27-28 जुलाई की बैठक के समापन पर दीर्घकालिक बाजार दरों में वृद्धि करेंगे. यूएडा ने जुलाई की शुरुआत में भारत के 20 वित्त मंत्रियों और केंद्रीय बैंकरों के समूह की बैठक में पुष्टि करते हुए नरम लहजे का इस्तेमाल किया था कि चीजें वैसी ही बनी रहेंगी. उन्होंने कहा, \"जब तक परिसर को स्थानांतरित नहीं किया जाता, पूरी कहानी अपरिवर्तित रहेगी।\". बैंक के अंदर की रिपोर्टें इस कथन का समर्थन करती प्रतीत हुईं; . वह 28 जुलाई की सुबह, टोक्यो समयानुसार, 2 बजे तक था, जब निक्केई अखबार में एक कहानी ने संकेत दिया कि 10-वर्षीय जापानी सरकारी ऋण पर दरों को 0 से ऊपर जाने की अनुमति दी जाएगी।. 5 प्रतिशत. उएदा के छोटे शासनकाल में यह दूसरी बार था कि जापानी मीडिया के पास सभा के अंदर की जानकारी थी. फिर भी, व्यापारियों के पास पूरी कहानी नहीं थी, रिपोर्ट में 1 प्रतिशत की सीमा का कोई उल्लेख नहीं था. जब अनंत प्रतीक्षा के बाद आधिकारिक घोषणा हुई - बीओजे ने अभी भी पहले से कोई समय नहीं दिया है कि नीति की घोषणा कब की जाएगी, जिससे डीलरों को स्क्रीन को ताज़ा करने में कोई फायदा नहीं हुआ - इसने 10 साल की उपज के लिए तीन अलग-अलग स्तरों के उल्लेख के साथ बाजार को भ्रमित कर दिया। . 5 प्रतिशत \"सीमा\" और 1 प्रतिशत \"सीमा\" जिस पर बैंक कदम उठाएगा). निवेशक अभी भी इस बात पर बहस कर रहे हैं कि इस कदम का क्या मतलब है. बोर्ड के पूर्व सदस्य सयूरी शिराई ने एक साक्षात्कार में कहा, \"जुलाई के फैसले की बहुत सारी व्याख्याएं हुईं, क्योंकि यह बहुत जटिल था और हर किसी ने इसे अलग-अलग तरीके से समझा।\". \"मुझे उम्मीद थी कि उएदा-सान थोड़ा स्पष्ट होगा. \"यह पहली बार नहीं है जब बैंक को उपज-वक्र नियंत्रण में बदलाव के बारे में सूचित करने के लिए संघर्ष करना पड़ा है. वास्तव में, हर बार बीओजे ने वाईसीसी को लागू करने के तरीके को बदल दिया है, इसने बहुत अलग तरीके से काम किया है, एक अस्पष्ट सीमा से एक परिभाषित सीमा तक जा रहा है, और अब वापस अस्पष्टता पर आ गया है. ऐसे युग में जब संचार केंद्रीय बैंक का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण उपकरण है, डेटा-संचालित यूएडीए का उद्देश्य स्पष्टता लाना था. उनके पूर्ववर्ती, हारुहिको कुरोदा की चौंकाने वाली और विस्मयकारी रणनीति जानबूझकर बाजार को आश्चर्यचकित करने और यह दिखाने के लिए डिज़ाइन की गई थी कि उनका मतलब इस तरह से व्यवसाय करना था कि मासाकी शिराकावा, जिन्होंने उनसे पहले बैंक का नेतृत्व किया था, को व्यापक रूप से नहीं आंका गया था।. लेकिन कुरोदा के लंबे दशक के कार्यकाल के अंत तक पर्यवेक्षक इससे थक चुके थे. अब, यूएडा को उसी विश्वसनीयता की कमी का सामना करना पड़ रहा है. जबकि बीओजे की नीति के बारे में गलतफहमी आंशिक रूप से इस बात की अज्ञानता को दर्शाती है कि बैंक कैसे काम करता है और जापान की अर्थव्यवस्था कैसे संचालित होती है, यूएडा ने इस बात पर अविश्वास गहरा कर दिया है कि क्या बैंक जो कहता है उसका मतलब है और जो वह कहता है उसका मतलब है।. एक हालिया टिप्पणी स्पष्टता की इस कमी को उजागर करती है. बीओजे 10-वर्षीय बांड के लिए बाजार में कब कदम रखेगा, इस सवाल के जवाब में डिप्टी गवर्नर शिनिची उचिदा ने पिछले सप्ताह कहा, \"इस स्तर पर मेरे दिमाग में कोई विशिष्ट स्तर नहीं है।\". लेकिन फिर उन्होंने एक सार्थक टिप्पणी की: \"मेरा मतलब है, अगर कोई होता तो भी मैं यह नहीं कहता. \"बीओजे संभवतः ईमानदार है जब वह कहता है कि 2 प्रतिशत मूल्य लक्ष्य अभी भी कुछ दूर है, भले ही एक सदस्य को प्रतीत होता है कि यह क्षितिज पर है. लेकिन सिर के नकलीपन के कारण यह जानना मुश्किल हो रहा है कि वह वास्तव में किस पर विश्वास करता है. सावधानी की आवश्यकता, उदारतापूर्वक कहें तो, संपूर्ण वाईसीसी परियोजना में अंतर्निहित हो सकती है. एवरकोर आईएसआई में वैश्विक नीति को कवर करने वाले कृष्णा गुहा ने इस दृष्टिकोण की तुलना विनिमय दर व्यवस्थाओं में बदलाव से की है. आप इस डर से कभी भी इसके बारे में पहले से बात नहीं करते हैं कि सट्टेबाज बहुत आगे निकल जाते हैं और परिणामस्वरूप, आश्चर्य के आवश्यक तत्व को बर्बाद कर देते हैं. उस सादृश्य में कुछ बात है. 1997-98 के एशियाई वित्तीय संकट के दौरान, अवमूल्यन के सवालों का सामना करने पर सरकारों की कार्यप्रणाली इनकार करने या अस्पष्ट करने की थी. अगले वर्षों में लैटिन अमेरिका के साथ भी ऐसा ही हुआ. एक और तुलना है: पूंजी नियंत्रण. सितंबर 1998 में देश से बाहर धन के प्रवाह पर प्रतिबंध लगाने के मलेशिया के फैसले के नेतृत्व में, मंत्री बदलाव की चर्चा को हतोत्साहित करेंगे. शिराई उन लोगों में से हैं जो तर्क देते हैं कि नकारात्मक दरों की गहरी अलोकप्रियता की भरपाई के लिए वाईसीसी स्वयं एक धोखा था, जिसके खिलाफ उन्होंने 2016 की शुरुआत में मतदान किया था।. बीओजे अभी भी उस निर्णय से खुद को बाहर निकालने के लिए काम कर रहा है. जापान में मुद्रा या ऋण संकट नहीं आने वाला है; . लेकिन संचार संकट कुछ और है. यह एक त्रासदी होगी यदि उनके पूर्ववर्ती के दूसरे कार्यकाल के अंत में व्याप्त अविश्वास और संशय, पद की शपथ लेने के कुछ ही महीनों बाद उएदा के कार्यकाल को परिभाषित करने लगे।. अपरंपरागत मौद्रिक नीति के रोमांच और प्रभाव ऐसे ही हैं. बाहर निकलने की तुलना में अंदर जाना आसान है. डेनियल मॉस एशियाई अर्थव्यवस्थाओं को कवर करने वाले ब्लूमबर्ग ओपिनियन स्तंभकार हैं. गियरॉइड रेडी ब्लूमबर्ग ओपिनियन स्तंभकार हैं. विचार व्यक्तिगत हैं, और इस प्रकाशन के रुख का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करते हैं. श्रेय: ब्लूमबर्ग\n",

      "टमाटर और अन्य खाद्य पदार्थों की ऊंची कीमतों के कारण चारों ओर घबराहट होने के बावजूद, भारत की मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) द्वारा अगस्त 2023 की नीति समीक्षा में लगातार तीसरी बार रोक लगाना एक पूर्वनिर्धारित निष्कर्ष था।. नीति ने बहुत कम आश्चर्य उत्पन्न किया, जिसमें सर्वसम्मति से रेपो दर को 6 पर अपरिवर्तित रखने का निर्णय लिया गया. 5 प्रतिशत. 5:1 के मत के साथ, यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए कि मुद्रास्फीति उत्तरोत्तर लक्ष्य के साथ संरेखित हो, विकास का समर्थन करते हुए, आवास की वापसी पर ध्यान केंद्रित रखने पर रुख बरकरार रखा गया।. जबकि आशावादी विकास पूर्वानुमान को अपेक्षित रूप से अपरिवर्तित छोड़ दिया गया था, मुद्रास्फीति पूर्वानुमान को 5 तक बढ़ा दिया गया था. 4 प्रतिशत, हमारी अपेक्षा से अधिक (+5)।. 3 प्रतिशत). इसके अलावा, वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (आई-सीआरआर) को अस्थायी रूप से लागू करना एक आश्चर्य के रूप में आया. जैसा कि अनुमान था, खाद्य और कच्चे तेल की कीमतों और विशेष रूप से अनियमित मानसून वितरण के कारण बढ़ती अनिश्चितताओं को देखते हुए, दस्तावेज़ का स्वर जून 2023 के नीति वक्तव्य की तुलना में अधिक आक्रामक था, भले ही इसकी अंतिम मात्रा सामान्य हो सकती है . एमपीसी ने इस बात पर प्रकाश डाला कि वह मुद्रास्फीति को लक्ष्य के अनुरूप करने के साथ-साथ मुद्रास्फीति की उम्मीदों को नियंत्रित करने की अपनी प्रतिबद्धता पर दृढ़ रहेगी।. पिछली दो नीतियों के अनुरूप, गवर्नर ने एक बार फिर जोर दिया कि सीपीआई मुद्रास्फीति को 2-6 प्रतिशत के सहनशीलता बैंड के भीतर लाना पर्याप्त नहीं है और मुद्रास्फीति को 4 के लक्ष्य के अनुरूप लाने पर ध्यान केंद्रित है।. 0 प्रतिशत. इसके अलावा, उन्होंने इस बात पर चिंता व्यक्त की कि बार-बार होने वाली खाद्य कीमतों के झटके की घटनाएं मुद्रास्फीति की उम्मीदों को नियंत्रित करने के लिए जोखिम पैदा करती हैं, जिससे इस नीति वक्तव्य की कठोरता बढ़ जाती है।. मुद्रास्फीति पर चेतावनी एमपीसी ने यह भी चेतावनी दी कि प्रतिकूल मौसम की स्थिति के कारण आपूर्ति में व्यवधान को देखते हुए तत्काल अवधि में मुख्य मुद्रास्फीति बढ़ने की संभावना है।. जैसे ही बाजार ने यह समझा कि केवल 6 प्रतिशत से नीचे गिरना पर्याप्त नहीं है, जुलाई 2023 के लिए जल्द ही जारी होने वाले प्रिंट में सीपीआई मुद्रास्फीति इस सीमा को जोरदार ढंग से पार करने के लिए तैयार है।. हमें संदेह है कि अल्पकालिक राहत के बाद, जुलाई और अगस्त सीपीआई मुद्रास्फीति प्रिंट 6 की असुविधाजनक सीमा में होंगे. 5-7. 0 प्रतिशत. इसमें कोई आश्चर्य की बात नहीं है कि एमपीसी ने वित्त वर्ष 2024 की दूसरी तिमाही के लिए मुद्रास्फीति के लिए अपने आधारभूत पूर्वानुमान को एक प्रतिशत की भारी वृद्धि के साथ 6 तक बढ़ा दिया है।. 5 से 2 प्रतिशत. 2 प्रतिशत. इसके बाद, यह मुद्रास्फीति को 5 तक कम होते हुए देखता है. वित्त वर्ष 2024 की तीसरी तिमाही में 7 प्रतिशत और फिर 5 प्रतिशत. Q4 FY2024 के साथ-साथ Q1 FY2025 में प्रत्येक में 2 प्रतिशत. उत्तरार्द्ध के आधार पर, हमें अब जून 2024 में दरों में कटौती शुरू होने की उम्मीद नहीं है, और हमने जल्द से जल्द कटौती के लिए अपने पूर्वानुमान को वित्त वर्ष 2025 की दूसरी तिमाही तक बढ़ा दिया है।. इसके अलावा, हमारा अनुमान है कि दर में कटौती का चक्र काफी उथला होगा, जो 50-75 बीपीएस तक सीमित होगा. साथ ही, एमपीसी ने यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए सतर्क रहने और उचित कार्य करने के लिए तैयार रहने की आवश्यकता पर जोर दिया कि झटकों का प्रभाव जारी न रहे।. हालाँकि इसने आश्वस्त किया कि यह विशिष्ट झटकों को देखता है, इसने चेतावनी दी कि यदि ऐसी विलक्षणताएँ बनी रहने के संकेत दिखाती हैं, तो इसे कार्रवाई करनी होगी. इससे दरों में रुक-रुक कर बढ़ोतरी का रास्ता खुला रहता है, हालांकि इसके लिए सीमा काफी ऊंची होगी. हमारे विचार में, मुद्रास्फीति को 6 से ऊपर बने रहने की आवश्यकता होगी. मुख्य मुद्रास्फीति पर दबाव के संचरण के बीच, दर में बढ़ोतरी के लिए मंच तैयार करने के लिए, कम से कम दो तिमाहियों के लिए 0 प्रतिशत. विकास को लेकर आशावादी बाहरी चुनौतियों और मानसून संबंधी जोखिमों के बावजूद, एमपीसी घरेलू उपभोग और निवेश की संभावनाओं को लेकर काफी उत्साहित रही।. हम 76 के क्षमता उपयोग के आंकड़े से विशेष रूप से उत्साहित हैं. वित्त वर्ष 2023 की चौथी तिमाही के लिए 3 प्रतिशत, और एक टिकाऊ और व्यापक-आधारित, यद्यपि यथार्थवादी, क्षमता विस्तार चक्र सेटिंग के बारे में सावधानीपूर्वक आशावादी हैं. इसके अलावा, केंद्र और राज्य सरकार दोनों का पूंजीगत व्यय पिछले दो वर्षों में पूर्व-कोविड स्तरों से काफी ऊपर चला गया है. हालांकि कार्यान्वयन महत्वपूर्ण रहेगा, हम उम्मीद करते हैं कि सरकार मध्यम अवधि में पूंजीगत व्यय के लिए आवंटन को प्राथमिकता देना जारी रखेगी, जिससे विकास की संभावनाओं को समर्थन मिलेगा।. हमारे अनुमान के अनुसार, I-CRR पर उपाय से बैंकिंग प्रणाली की लगभग 900-950 बिलियन रुपये की तरलता जब्त हो जाएगी।. परिणामस्वरूप, हम उम्मीद करते हैं कि कॉल मनी दरें, ट्रेजरी बिल और वाणिज्यिक पत्र जैसे मुद्रा बाजार उपकरणों पर अल्पकालिक दरें निकट अवधि में 15-20 बीपीएस बढ़ जाएंगी।. नीति की घोषणा के बाद, मौजूदा बेंचमार्क 10-वर्षीय सरकारी सुरक्षा की उपज में गिरावट आई, हालांकि एक संकीर्ण सीमा में. एक नई बेंचमार्क सुरक्षा का शुक्रवार को अनावरण होने वाला है. सीमित राजकोषीय चिंताओं और एमपीसी से विस्तारित विराम की उच्च संभावना के बीच, हम 7 की सीमा में इसकी उपज की उम्मीद करते हैं. 1-7. अगले दो महीनों में 2 प्रतिशत. तरलता की अधिकता को समाप्त करने के उपाय के परिणामस्वरूप, उपज वक्र तत्काल अवधि में और अधिक समतल होने की संभावना है. अदिति नायर मुख्य अर्थशास्त्री और प्रमुख-अनुसंधान एवं प्रमुख हैं। . विचार व्यक्तिगत हैं, और इस प्रकाशन के रुख का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करते हैं\n",

      "जहां तक ​​नीतिगत दरों का सवाल है, भारतीय रिज़र्व बैंक (आरबीआई) का अपने मौद्रिक नीति वक्तव्य में दर निर्णय काफी हद तक अपेक्षित - यथास्थिति पर था।. फरवरी की नीति के बाद से, हम उम्मीद कर रहे हैं कि आरबीआई एक विस्तारित विराम मोड में रहेगा, और वर्तमान नीति निर्णय हमारी अपेक्षाओं के अनुरूप है।. खाद्य और सब्जियों की कीमतों में हालिया बढ़ोतरी निकट भविष्य के लिए चिंता का विषय रही है, क्योंकि यह उपभोक्ता मूल्य मुद्रास्फीति (सीपीआई) के नीचे की ओर अस्थायी रूप से बाधित होती है, जिसे आरबीआई अपनी मौद्रिक नीति कार्रवाइयों और तरलता के माध्यम से सफलतापूर्वक हासिल करने में सक्षम रहा है। . मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) ने Q2FY24 के लिए अपने मुद्रास्फीति पूर्वानुमान को उल्लेखनीय रूप से (100 बीपीएस) बढ़ाकर 6 कर दिया है।. 2 प्रतिशत, जो आरबीआई के सहनशीलता बैंड की 6 प्रतिशत ऊपरी सीमा से परे है. एमपीसी ने अपने सीपीआई अनुमानों को तीसरी तिमाही के लिए 30 बीपीएस और पूरे वित्त वर्ष 2023-24 के लिए कुल मिलाकर 30 बीपीएस बढ़ा दिया है।. हालाँकि, जैसा कि हम उम्मीद कर रहे थे, एमपीसी ने खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति में मौजूदा वृद्धि (गैर-मौसमी बारिश, अल नीनो, आदि के कारण) पर गौर करने का निर्णय लिया है।. ), क्योंकि यह इस स्पाइक को अस्थायी मानता है. हालाँकि, उल्लेखनीय बात यह है कि आरबीआई ने Q1FY25 (i) के लिए सीपीआई का अनुमान लगाया है. इ. , अगले वित्तीय वर्ष के अप्रैल-जून) ऊंचे 5 पर. 2 प्रतिशत. 4 के गवर्नर द्वारा निरंतर सुदृढीकरण को देखते हुए. 0 प्रतिशत औसत सीपीआई लक्ष्य, नवीनतम पूर्वानुमान मूल रूप से वित्त वर्ष 2014 में किसी भी दर में कटौती की उम्मीदों को खारिज कर देते हैं. जब तक वैश्विक विकास में कोई महत्वपूर्ण गिरावट नहीं होती जिसका घरेलू विकास पर प्रभाव पड़ता है, यह बहुत कम संभावना लगती है कि आरबीआई चालू वित्तीय वर्ष के दौरान अपना रुख बदलेगा।. यह भी पढ़ें: मुद्रास्फीति के खिलाफ लड़ाई में, एमपीसी मुश्किल स्थिति के बीच फंसी हुई है। इस नीति वक्तव्य में थोड़ा आश्चर्यचकित करने वाला तत्व शुद्ध मांग पर 10 प्रतिशत वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (आई-सीआरआर के रूप में संदर्भित) की शुरूआत थी। . गवर्नर ने स्वीकार किया है कि आरबीआई की परिवर्तनीय दर रिवर्स रेपो (वीआरआरआर) नीलामी से तरलता की निकासी पर पूर्ण वांछित प्रभाव नहीं पड़ रहा है, जो अधिशेष मोड में है, क्योंकि बैंक वीआरआरआर के बजाय अपनी अतिरिक्त तरलता को एसडीएफ विंडो में रखना पसंद कर रहे हैं। . आई-सीआरआर उपाय का उद्देश्य अस्थायी (8 सितंबर तक संभव) और गैर-विघटनकारी होना है; . कुल मिलाकर, आरबीआई की नीति एक ओर मुद्रास्फीति पर नियंत्रण और दूसरी ओर तरलता को सीमित रखते हुए विकास को समर्थन देने के बीच सामंजस्यपूर्ण संतुलन बनाए रखने पर केंद्रित है।. तरलता को मजबूत करने पर केंद्रीय बैंक के फोकस के कारण निकट अवधि में उपज वक्र सपाट बने रहेंगे. यह भी पढ़ें: दास का कहना है कि मुद्रास्फीति के आंकड़ों पर बिना सोचे-समझे प्रतिक्रिया देने से बचना चाहिए। यह नीति, हालांकि पिछली नीति की तुलना में कम कठोर प्रतीत होती है, दर में कटौती या यहां तक ​​कि नीतिगत रुख (लंबे समय से चली आ रही नीति) को कमजोर करने की किसी भी उम्मीद को और पीछे धकेल देती है। . अगले कुछ महीनों में घरेलू ब्याज दरें ऊंची बनी रहेंगी, जब तक कि हेडलाइन सीपीआई के नीचे की ओर प्रक्षेपवक्र फिर से शुरू न हो जाए, या विकास की स्थिति सार्थक रूप से कम न हो जाए।. वर्तमान परिदृश्य में, निवेशक उच्च ब्याज दर व्यवस्था का लाभ उठा सकते हैं और लघु-मध्यम अवधि की निश्चित आय के अवसरों में निवेश कर सकते हैं, जबकि लंबी अवधि के निवेश के लिए आवंटन को लंबे निवेश क्षितिज को ध्यान में रखते हुए अधिमानतः क्रमबद्ध किया जा सकता है।. अस्वीकरण: मनीकंट्रोल पर निवेश विशेषज्ञों द्वारा व्यक्त विचार और निवेश युक्तियाँ. com उनका अपना है न कि वेबसाइट या उसके प्रबंधन का. मोनेकॉंट्रोल. कॉम उपयोगकर्ताओं को कोई भी निवेश निर्णय लेने से पहले प्रमाणित विशेषज्ञों से जांच करने की सलाह देता है\n",

      "प्रिय पाठक, विभिन्न लोगों के लिए एक कहावत है: 'ज्ञान यह जानना है कि टमाटर एक फल है, ज्ञान इसे फलों के सलाद में डालना नहीं है'. फिर भी मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) ने अपनी शाश्वत शर्मिंदगी के लिए कहा, \"आगे चलकर, टमाटर के नेतृत्व में सब्जियों की कीमतों में बढ़ोतरी, निकट अवधि की हेडलाइन मुद्रास्फीति प्रक्षेपवक्र पर बड़ा दबाव डालेगी।\". \"स्पष्ट रूप से, उन्हें इस बात का ज्ञान नहीं है कि टमाटर एक फल है, वास्तव में ऐसा माना जाता है कि इसमें कामोत्तेजक शक्तियाँ होती हैं, जैसा कि फ्रांसीसी द्वारा इसे पोमे डी'अमोर, या लव एप्पल कहकर प्रमाणित किया गया है।. इसका फायदा यह है कि, इसी तर्क से, एमपीसी सदस्यों द्वारा फलों के सलाद में टमाटर डालने की संभावना नहीं है, इस प्रकार उनके पास जो ज्ञान की कमी है उसे समझदारी से पूरा किया जा सकता है।. चालू वित्त वर्ष के लिए खुदरा मुद्रास्फीति का पूर्वानुमान 5 तक बढ़ाने के बावजूद, खाद्य कीमतों में वृद्धि को कम मुद्रास्फीति से परे देखने और नीति दर को अपरिवर्तित रखने के उनके दृढ़ संकल्प में यह बुद्धिमत्ता दिखाई देती है।. 4 प्रतिशत, 5 से ऊपर. जून में पिछली एमपीसी बैठक में 1 प्रतिशत का अनुमान लगाया गया था. दूसरे तरीके से कहें तो, व्यापक धारणा के बावजूद कि टमाटर की कीमतें गर्म आलू हैं, एमपीसी को लगता है कि यह छोटा आलू है. हालाँकि, इसका मतलब यह नहीं है कि आरबीआई गवर्नर खीरे की तरह शांत हैं और वह टमाटर के बारे में कुछ नहीं बताते हैं. उन्होंने कहा, 'हालाँकि, बार-बार खाद्य कीमतों में झटके लगने की घटनाएं मुद्रास्फीति की उम्मीदों के स्थिर होने का जोखिम पैदा करती हैं।'. उन्होंने आगे कहा, 'हमें जरूरत पड़ने पर नीतिगत उपकरणों को तैनात करने के लिए अर्जुन की नजर से परे जाने के लिए तैयार रहना होगा. 'जैसा कि मेरी सहकर्मी अपर्णा अय्यर बताती हैं, इन उपकरणों में वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात में वृद्धि शामिल हो सकती है, जो तरलता को प्रभावित करेगी।. जबकि मुद्रास्फीति का परिदृश्य थोड़ा निराशाजनक है, एमपीसी विकास के बारे में संभावनाओं से भरी है. FY24 के लिए ग्रोथ का अनुमान 6 पर बरकरार रखा गया है. 5 प्रतिशत. इसके अलावा, आरबीआई गवर्नर ने यह भी कहा, 'बैंकों और अन्य स्रोतों से वाणिज्यिक क्षेत्र में संसाधनों का कुल प्रवाह ₹7 तक बढ़ गया है।. वित्तीय वर्ष 2023-24 के दौरान अब तक (28 जुलाई तक) ₹5 की तुलना में 5 लाख करोड़ रु.. एक साल पहले 7 लाख करोड़ रु. 'यह 31 की वृद्धि है. एक वर्ष पहले की तुलना में 6 प्रतिशत, केंद्रीय बैंक द्वारा दरों में बढ़ोतरी के बावजूद, अर्थव्यवस्था में मजबूत विकास गति का प्रमाण है. उस तरह की विकास गति और प्रचुर तरलता के साथ, क्या मुद्रास्फीति का व्यापक अर्थव्यवस्था पर असर पड़ने का जोखिम हो सकता है? . यह इतना छोटा-सा छोटा-सा कदम है कि इसने मुझे प्रसिद्ध गीत की इन पंक्तियों की याद दिला दी: वह लॉकर से बाहर आने से डर रही थी वह उतनी ही घबराई हुई थी जितनी वह हो सकती थी. जो भी हो, आरबीआई ने दोहराया है कि वह 'मुद्रास्फीति को 4 के लक्ष्य तक लाने पर दृढ़ता से ध्यान केंद्रित कर रहा है'. 0 प्रतिशत', जिसका मतलब है कि इस वित्तीय वर्ष में किसी भी दर में कटौती की संभावना कम है - नीति दर लंबे समय तक ऊंची रहेगी. क्या इसका मतलब यह है कि विकास धीमा हो जाएगा? . ऐसा नहीं लगता कि बढ़ती ब्याज दरों ने विकास को रोका है या मुनाफ़े को प्रभावित किया है. और सरकार निश्चित है कि अगले साल आम चुनाव से पहले खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति को कम करने के लिए वह सब कुछ करेगी जो वह कर सकती है. आरबीआई गवर्नर दास ने यह भी कहा कि सरकारी पूंजीगत व्यय, बढ़ती व्यावसायिक आशावाद और कुछ प्रमुख क्षेत्रों में निजी पूंजीगत व्यय में पुनरुद्धार के कारण निवेश गतिविधि में तेजी आई है।. निर्माण गतिविधि मजबूत बनी हुई है. इसके अलावा, दास ने स्पष्ट रूप से कहा, 'कुल मांग की स्थिति लगातार अच्छी बनी हुई है. 'टमाटर से अस्थायी डर के बावजूद, इन सभी को बाजारों का समर्थन करना चाहिए. भारतीय अर्थव्यवस्था के लिए, यह अभी भी आड़ू और क्रीम है. हमारी शोध टीम से निवेश संबंधी अंतर्दृष्टि बैंकों पर आरबीआई की मौद्रिक नीति का क्या प्रभाव हो सकता है? . हमारे पास पत्रकारों की एक बेहतरीन टीम है जो स्टार्टअप और तकनीक से जुड़ी हर चीज़ पर लिखती है. हम उनके न्यूज़लेटर Tech3 के प्रशंसक हैं जो हर कार्यदिवस की शाम को हमारे इनबॉक्स में आता है. आप समाचार, स्कूप और विश्लेषण सहित दिन भर की तकनीकी और स्टार्टअप कहानियों पर नज़र रख सकते हैं. यदि आपने पहले से इसकी सदस्यता नहीं ली है, तो साइन अप करने के लिए इस लिंक पर क्लिक करें. मनीकंट्रोल प्रो की सदस्यता लेने के लिए धन्यवाद. चुनिंदा ब्रांडों और उपहारों पर विशेष छूट के लिए यहां हमारा ऑफ़र पृष्ठ देखें. हमें आपसे सुनना प्रिय लगेगा. उत्पाद पर किसी भी प्रतिक्रिया और सुझाव के लिए कृपया यहां क्लिक करें. हम आपकी प्रतिक्रियाओं को पढ़ने का वादा करते हैं, हालाँकि हम प्रत्येक को व्यक्तिगत रूप से उत्तर देने में सक्षम नहीं हो सकते हैं. मानस चक्रवर्ती मनीकंट्रोल प्रो\n",

      "एमपीसी बैठक: आरबीआई का ध्यान मुद्रास्फीति को कम करने पर केंद्रित है\n",
      "भारतीय रिजर्व बैंक (आरबीआई) की मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) ने ब्याज दरों पर अपनी पीठ थपथपाई है, जबकि उन्नत देशों के केंद्रीय बैंकों ने दरों में बढ़ोतरी जारी रखी है।. 2,000 रुपये के नोटों की वापसी से बनी अतिरिक्त तरलता को खत्म करने के लिए वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात की शुरूआत, जिसकी उम्मीद नहीं थी, अल्पकालिक दरों को अस्थायी रूप से सख्त कर सकती है।. हालाँकि, RBI का नीतिगत रुख बाज़ारों के लिए कोई आश्चर्य की बात नहीं है. जाहिर है, उन्नत देशों में दरों में बढ़ोतरी अधिक आक्रामक रही है क्योंकि वे भारत की तुलना में अधिक मुद्रास्फीति की चुनौती का सामना कर रहे हैं. उदाहरण के लिए, अमेरिकी फेडरल रिजर्व ने वर्तमान लंबी पैदल यात्रा चक्र में दरों में भारत के 250 बीपीएस के मुकाबले 525 आधार अंक (बीपीएस) की बढ़ोतरी की है।. जबकि फेड की नवीनतम बढ़ोतरी वर्तमान चक्र के लिए आखिरी हो सकती है, यूरोपीय सेंट्रल बैंक से नीति को सख्त करने की उम्मीद है क्योंकि उसके दायरे में मुद्रास्फीति स्थिर रही है. कुल मिलाकर, पश्चिम में ब्याज दरें लंबे समय तक ऊंची रहने की संभावना है, क्योंकि हेडलाइन मुद्रास्फीति रेडलाइन से ऊपर बनी हुई है और मुख्य मुद्रास्फीति स्थिर है।. इसके विपरीत, मुद्रास्फीति में नरमी के कारण एशिया में मौद्रिक नीति पर दबाव कम हो गया है. मुद्रास्फीति फिर से बढ़ी मुद्रास्फीति पर आरबीआई की सावधानी ने इसे अच्छी स्थिति में खड़ा कर दिया है क्योंकि मुद्रास्फीति, जो जून की नीति घोषणा के दौरान चरम पर थी, फिर से बढ़ गई है. मिंट रोड लगातार बता रहा है कि लड़ाई अभी ख़त्म नहीं हुई है और अगस्त की नीति समीक्षा इस रुख को दोहराती है. पहली तिमाही में मजबूत आर्थिक वृद्धि को देखते हुए, आरबीआई ने भारत की जीडीपी वृद्धि के लिए अपने पूर्वानुमान को 6 पर अपरिवर्तित रखा. 5 प्रतिशत. लेकिन खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति में हालिया बढ़ोतरी ने आरबीआई के जुलाई-सितंबर सीपीआई पूर्वानुमान 5 को बढ़ा दिया है. 2 प्रतिशत - यह संख्या अब बढ़कर 6 हो गई है. 2 प्रतिशत. चालू वित्त वर्ष के लिए, उसे उम्मीद है कि सीपीआई मुद्रास्फीति प्रिंट 5 होगी. जून के पूर्वानुमान से 4 प्रतिशत या 30 बीपीएस अधिक. विभिन्न संकेतक पहली तिमाही में समग्र रूप से मजबूत विकास गति की ओर इशारा करते हैं. सरकारी निवेश तेजी से बढ़ा है और ऋण वृद्धि काफी अच्छी है. परचेजिंग मैनेजर्स इंडेक्स मजबूत विस्तार क्षेत्र में था और जुलाई को समाप्त होने वाले चार महीनों के दौरान विनिर्माण और सेवाओं के लिए इसका औसत क्रमशः 58 और 61 था।. माल निर्यात में लगातार पांच महीनों तक गिरावट जारी रही, लेकिन इससे समग्र आर्थिक गतिविधि धीमी नहीं हुई है. दिलचस्प बात यह है कि ऊंची वृद्धि मुद्रास्फीति पर बढ़ते दबाव का मुख्य कारण नहीं है. बल्कि इसके लिए खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति दोषी है. मुख्य मुद्रास्फीति के सेवा भाग के विपरीत, जो सेवाओं की मजबूत मांग के कारण दबाव में रहता है, माल खुदरा मुद्रास्फीति में लगातार गिरावट देखी जा रही है।. उपभोक्ता मूल्य सूचकांक (सीपीआई) में एक तिहाई भार के साथ वस्तु मुद्रास्फीति, इनपुट लागत में तेज सुधार के कारण जून 2023 में पिछले साल के इसी महीने की तुलना में 12 प्रतिशत कम हो गई।. थोक मूल्य सूचकांक का गैर-खाद्य हिस्सा, जो इनपुट लागत का एक प्रॉक्सी है, जून में साल दर साल गिर गया. कंपनियों ने लागत कटौती का कुछ हिस्सा अंतिम उपभोक्ता को दिया है और दूसरे का उपयोग लाभ मार्जिन को कम करने के लिए किया है. यह प्रवृत्ति पूरे वर्ष जारी रहने की संभावना है, जैसा कि आईआईएम अहमदाबाद के बिजनेस इन्फ्लेशन एक्सपेक्टेशन सर्वे द्वारा सुझाया गया है - फर्मों की औसत वर्ष-आगे की मुद्रास्फीति उम्मीदें लगातार दो महीनों तक 4 प्रतिशत के भीतर रहीं।. इसके अतिरिक्त, उच्च आधार प्रभाव के कारण ईंधन मुद्रास्फीति कम एकल अंक में है क्योंकि कच्चे तेल की कीमतें पिछले साल के स्तर से पीछे चल रही हैं. अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर कच्चे तेल की कीमतों में जारी बढ़ोतरी इस मोर्चे पर चिंताएं बढ़ाती है. मुख्य मुद्रास्फीति का सेवा घटक, जिसका सीपीआई में 27 प्रतिशत भार है, नीचे आया लेकिन पिछले कुछ महीनों में स्थिर रहा है. खाद्य कीमतों से दबाव खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति, 40 प्रतिशत भार के साथ, मुद्रास्फीति का विशिष्ट हिस्सा है. अनाज, दालों और मसालों की महंगाई दोहरे अंक में है और मौसम और कीटों के झटके के कारण सब्जियों की कीमतें तेजी से बढ़ी हैं. सब्जियों की महंगाई, जहां बढ़ोतरी आम तौर पर अस्थायी होती है और लगभग दो महीनों में सही हो जाती है, कोई स्थायी चिंता नहीं है. लेकिन घरेलू और वैश्विक कारकों के कारण खाद्यान्न मुद्रास्फीति मुश्किल साबित हो सकती है. हमारे शोध से पता चलता है कि मानसून सामान्य होने पर भी खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति अधिक हो सकती है. उदाहरण के लिए, पिछले चार सामान्य मानसून वर्षों में से तीन में खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति 6 प्रतिशत से अधिक रही. अधिक बारिश और देरी से बुआई के कारण खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति का खतरा सब्जियों पर मंडरा रहा है. मानसून के मौसम के उत्तरार्ध में शुष्क परिस्थितियों से जुड़े कमजोर अल नीनो की संभावना की पुष्टि भारतीय मौसम विभाग ने हाल ही में की थी. वैश्विक परिप्रेक्ष्य से, अल नीनो अन्य प्रमुख वैश्विक उत्पादक अर्थव्यवस्थाओं में फसलों के लिए भी जोखिम है, जैसे इंडोनेशिया और मलेशिया में पाम तेल और थाईलैंड और वियतनाम में चावल।. इनमें से पाम तेल भारत के लिए प्रमुख आयात है. वर्तमान में, खाद्य तेल की कीमतें पिछले साल की तुलना में कम हैं, लेकिन एक वैश्विक झटका इसे उलट सकता है. रिकॉर्ड के लिए, भारत अपनी खाद्य तेल आवश्यकता का 60 प्रतिशत आयात करता है. खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति के बारे में चिंता सरकार द्वारा उठाए जा रहे एहतियाती कदमों से स्पष्ट है, जैसे कि कुछ प्रकार के चावल के निर्यात पर प्रतिबंध लगाना, गेहूं पर भंडारण सीमा लगाना और कम कीमतों पर बाजार में हस्तक्षेप करना।. इस परिदृश्य में, हम उम्मीद करते हैं कि अगले साल की शुरुआत में दर में कटौती होगी यदि मौजूदा खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति का दबाव क्षणभंगुर साबित होता है और हेडलाइन मुद्रास्फीति अनुमानित प्रक्षेपवक्र पर बनी रहती है।. हालाँकि आरबीआई की दरों में बढ़ोतरी सीधे आपूर्ति-संचालित खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति को प्रभावित नहीं कर सकती है, लेकिन यह एक चिंता का विषय बन जाता है अगर यह कायम रहती है, अन्य घटकों तक फैल जाती है, और हेडलाइन मुद्रास्फीति को अपने लक्ष्य से दूर ले जाती है. इसलिए, मिंट रोड खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति पर अपनी नजरें गड़ाए रखेगा. धर्मकीर्ति जोशी क्रिसिल के मुख्य अर्थशास्त्री हैं. विचार व्यक्तिगत हैं, और इस प्रकाशन के रुख का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करते हैं\n",

      "घरेलू यात्री वाहनों की थोक बिक्री 2 दर्ज की गई. सोसायटी ऑफ इंडियन ऑटोमोबाइल मैन्युफैक्चरर्स ने गुरुवार को कहा कि जुलाई में साल-दर-साल 94 फीसदी की बढ़ोतरी के साथ 3,02,521 यूनिट्स की बढ़ोतरी हुई।. सोसाइटी ऑफ इंडियन ऑटोमोबाइल मैन्युफैक्चरर्स (सियाम) द्वारा जारी नवीनतम आंकड़ों के अनुसार, जुलाई 2022 में निर्माताओं से डीलरों तक यात्री वाहनों (पीवी) की डिलीवरी 2,93,865 इकाई थी।. पिछले महीने दोपहिया वाहनों की घरेलू थोक बिक्री घटकर 12,82,054 इकाई रह गई, जबकि जुलाई 2022 में यह 13,81,303 इकाई थी।. तिपहिया वाहनों की थोक बिक्री 56,034 इकाई रही, जो एक साल पहले इसी महीने में 31,324 इकाई थी।. सियाम ने कहा कि विभिन्न श्रेणियों में कुल वाहन डिस्पैच 16,40,727 इकाइयां थीं, जबकि जुलाई 2022 में यह 17,06,545 इकाइयां थीं।. “हालांकि यात्री वाहन और तिपहिया खंड अच्छा प्रदर्शन कर रहे हैं, जुलाई 2022 की तुलना में जुलाई 2023 में दोपहिया वाहनों की वृद्धि में गिरावट आई है।.

      "WeWork की कांच की दीवारें बंद होने लगी हैं\n",
      "जब WeWork Inc अंततः 2021 में सार्वजनिक हुआ, तो आशा थी कि यह उन ज्यादतियों को पीछे छोड़ देगा जो सह-संस्थापक एडम न्यूमैन के नेतृत्व की पहचान थीं और घर से काम करने के युग के लिए एक गंभीर लचीला कार्यक्षेत्र प्रदाता बन जाएगा।. कंपनी की दूसरी तिमाही के नतीजों में शामिल इस सप्ताह की \"चल रही चिंता\" चेतावनी से पता चलता है कि अगले 12 महीने चार साल पहले WeWork के लगभग विस्फोट के समान ही भयावह होंगे।. प्रभावी उपचारात्मक कार्रवाई या अन्य पूंजी जुटाने के अभाव में, यह बंद हो सकता है. 2019 में सार्वजनिक होने के अपने पहले विनाशकारी प्रयास के बाद से WeWork ने सैकड़ों रियल एस्टेट पट्टों को समाप्त कर दिया है और निश्चित लागत और पूंजीगत व्यय में कटौती की है; . मार्च में ऋण पुनर्गठन ने अपनी उधारी को कम करके, ब्याज भुगतान को कम करके और 2027 तक परिपक्वता अवधि बढ़ाकर अतिरिक्त राहत की गुंजाइश हासिल की।. हालाँकि, कंपनी की बैलेंस शीट अभी भी ख़राब है और उसे बड़ी मात्रा में धन का नुकसान हो रहा है, पिछले छह महीनों में $650 मिलियन का नुकसान हुआ है और नकदी भंडार घटकर केवल $205 मिलियन रह गया है।. एक दशक से भी अधिक समय पहले स्थापित होने के बाद से WeWork को लगभग $17 बिलियन का नुकसान हुआ है. निराशाजनक वाणिज्यिक रियल एस्टेट बाजार में इस स्थिति को सुधारना कठिन होगा: टेक ग्राहक बजट में कटौती कर रहे हैं और WeWork अपनी अधिकांश बिक्री अमेरिका और ब्रिटेन में उत्पन्न करता है - मुख्य रूप से लंदन, सैन फ्रांसिस्को और न्यूयॉर्क जैसे बड़े शहरों में जहां सर्फ़ बढ़ रहा है . निश्चित रूप से, भवन मालिक नहीं चाहेंगे कि इतना महत्वपूर्ण पट्टेदार विफल हो जाए, जिससे उनके पास एक ही बार में किराए पर देने के लिए बड़ी मात्रा में जगह बच जाए।. इसलिए WeWork के पास पट्टों पर फिर से बातचीत करने का अधिकार है, जिनमें से कुछ नवीनीकरण के लिए आ रहे हैं. (हालाँकि, दीर्घकालिक पट्टों को रद्द करना सीधा नहीं है, और इसके लिए समाप्ति शुल्क भुगतान की आवश्यकता हो सकती है). कंपनी को अधिक किरायेदारों को आकर्षित करके राजस्व बढ़ाने की सख्त जरूरत है, लेकिन इसके विपरीत हो रहा है: दिसंबर से सदस्यता में 3 प्रतिशत की गिरावट आई है, जबकि इसी अवधि के दौरान अधिभोग 75 प्रतिशत से गिरकर 72 प्रतिशत हो गया है।. आईडब्ल्यूजी पीएलसी जैसे प्रतिद्वंद्वी साझा कार्यक्षेत्र प्रदाताओं के साथ प्रतिस्पर्धा के कारण सदस्यता की कीमतें बढ़ाना मुश्किल है, जो कि वेवर्क की घोषणा के बाद बुधवार को लंदन ट्रेडिंग में 10 प्रतिशत तक बढ़ गई।. WeWork को दृढ़ नेतृत्व की आवश्यकता है, लेकिन इसके बजाय वह खुद को एक खालीपन के साथ पाता है: मुख्य कार्यकारी अधिकारी संदीप मथरानी और मुख्य वित्तीय अधिकारी आंद्रे फर्नांडीज दोनों ने मई में अप्रत्याशित रूप से पद छोड़ दिया. मथरानी कमरे में एक आश्वस्त समझदार वयस्क थीं और, अब तक कंपनी ने किसी स्थायी प्रतिस्थापन का नाम नहीं दिया है. नवीनतम खातों के अनुसार, मतभेद की भावना को बढ़ाते हुए, प्रशासन और कंपनी की रणनीतिक और सामरिक दिशा के संबंध में \"भौतिक असहमति\" के कारण तीन बोर्ड निदेशकों ने पिछले सप्ताह इस्तीफा दे दिया।. आधिकारिक स्वीकृति कि कंपनी का नकदी भंडार अगले 12 महीनों तक जीवित रहने के लिए पर्याप्त नहीं हो सकता है, ग्राहकों को और अधिक परेशान करेगा. फाइलिंग में कहा गया है, \"यह धारणा कि हम एक चालू कंपनी के रूप में जारी रखने में सक्षम नहीं हो सकते हैं, हमारे अनुबंध संबंधी दायित्वों को पूरा करने की हमारी क्षमता के बारे में चिंताओं के कारण सदस्यों, मकान मालिकों और अन्य लोगों को हमारे साथ व्यापार नहीं करने का विकल्प चुन सकते हैं।\". WeWork ग्राहकों को खोने का जोखिम नहीं उठा सकता क्योंकि इसके बाद उसे उनकी सुरक्षा जमा राशि वापस करनी पड़ सकती है, जिससे नकदी की और अधिक खपत होगी. इस साल की शुरुआत में जब WeWork के ऋण का कुछ हिस्सा इक्विटी में बांट दिया गया था, तब शेयरधारकों में भारी गिरावट आई थी - लिस्टिंग के बाद से स्टॉक में 98 प्रतिशत की गिरावट आई है. WeWork का ऋण जल्द ही परिपक्व होने वाला नहीं है, लेकिन इसके बांडधारक भी पूर्ण वसूली के बारे में आशावादी नहीं हैं; . 2025 में परिपक्व होने वाले 875 प्रतिशत वरिष्ठ असुरक्षित नोटों का इस सप्ताह डॉलर पर केवल 33 सेंट पर कारोबार हुआ. हालाँकि ऋण पुनर्गठन ने कंपनी को कुछ हद तक ढीला कर दिया, लगभग 500 मिलियन डॉलर की उधारी पर एक अस्थायी ब्याज दर है जो 15 प्रतिशत तक बढ़ गई है. जुलाई में 475 मिलियन डॉलर की सॉफ्टबैंक ग्रुप कॉर्प संबद्ध ऋण सुविधा से 175 मिलियन डॉलर निकालने का कंपनी का निर्णय भी आश्वस्त करने वाला नहीं है - मई में, पूर्व प्रबंधन ने कहा था कि इसकी कोई आवश्यकता नहीं थी, जबकि यह स्वीकार करते हुए कि कंपनी दूसरी छमाही तक कैशफ्लो ब्रेकईवन तक नहीं पहुंच पाएगी। . बड़ा अज्ञात यह है कि बहुसंख्यक मालिक सॉफ्टबैंक फिर से बचाव के लिए आगे आएगा या नहीं. वॉल स्ट्रीट जर्नल के अनुसार, जापानी तकनीकी निवेशक ने अपने WeWork दुस्साहस पर 2017 से $12 बिलियन की भारी रकम खो दी है।. एक और बेलआउट अप्रभावी है - लेकिन इसके बिना, WeWork की संभावनाएँ धूमिल दिखती हैं. क्रिस ब्रायंट यूरोप में औद्योगिक कंपनियों को कवर करने वाले ब्लूमबर्ग ओपिनियन स्तंभकार हैं. विचार व्यक्तिगत हैं और इस प्रकाशन के रुख का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करते हैं. श्रेय: ब्लूमबर्ग\n",

      "बेंगलुरु शहर पुलिस द्वारा शहर के तकनीकी गलियारे में कंपनियों को सुझाए गए यातायात-घटाने के उपायों में कार्यालय समय में बदलाव, कारपूलिंग और कर्मचारियों के लिए समर्पित बसें शामिल हैं।. यह हैदराबाद द्वारा बाधित यातायात से निपटने के लिए इसी तरह के उपायों को लागू करने के बाद आया है. बेंगलुरु शहर के पुलिस आयुक्त बी दयानंद और वरिष्ठ पुलिस अधिकारियों ने संपर्क दिवस में भाग लिया, जो आउटर रिंग रोड पर आईटी-बीटी कंपनियों के साथ कर्नाटक के गृह मंत्री जी परमेश्वर की बैठक से पहले एक आउटरीच कार्यक्रम था, जो बेंगलुरु का तकनीकी गलियारा है।. तकनीकी कंपनियों और आउटर रिंग रोड कंपनीज एसोसिएशन (ओआरआरसीए) के प्रतिनिधियों के साथ 9 अगस्त को सुबह 11 बजे से दोपहर 1 बजे तक बाहरी रिंग रोड पर बेलंदूर में इकोस्पेस बिजनेस पार्क में यातायात प्रबंधन से लेकर सुरक्षा तक विभिन्न मुद्दों पर चर्चा करने के लिए बैठक हुई।. संयुक्त पुलिस आयुक्त (बेंगलुरु ट्रैफिक) एमएन अनुचेथ ने मनीकंट्रोल को बताया कि उन्होंने ट्रैफिक को सुव्यवस्थित करने के लिए ओआरआरसीए और तकनीकी कंपनियों को कई उपाय सुझाए हैं।. इन उपायों में विशेष रूप से लॉग-आउट के लिए कार्यालय समय को चौंका देना शामिल है; . \"कार्यालय के समय में परिवर्तन से हमें यातायात को सुव्यवस्थित करने में मदद मिलेगी, खासकर शाम के समय. हमारा इरादा उन पर कोई विशेष समय थोपने का नहीं है, बल्कि उन्हें अपने आंतरिक मूल्यांकन के आधार पर उपयुक्त समय तय करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करना है।. इस तरह, विभिन्न कंपनियों के लॉग-आउट मेल नहीं खाएंगे,\" उन्होंने समझाया. साइबराबाद पुलिस ने भी आईटी कंपनियों को घर से काम (डब्ल्यूएफएच) करने और धीरे-धीरे लॉग-आउट करने की सलाह दी थी।. अनुचेथ ने कहा कि उन्होंने आउटर रिंग रोड (ओआरआर) पर काम करने वाले कर्मचारियों के लिए समर्पित बसों का प्रस्ताव रखा और ओआरआर पर निजी वाहनों की संख्या कम करने के लिए कारपूलिंग पर जोर दिया।. मनीकंट्रोल ने खबर दी थी कि 6. सिल्क बोर्ड और केआर पुरम के बीच प्रतिदिन 4 लाख कर्मचारी 3 का उपयोग करके आवागमन करते हैं. निजी कारों और कैब सहित 3 लाख वाहन. अनुचेथ ने कहा, ''निजी कैब वर्तमान में ओआरआर की सर्विस रोड पर खड़ी हैं. हमने परिसरों के भीतर इन वाहनों के लिए पार्किंग स्थान बनाने की अनुमति देने का सुझाव दिया है, यह देखते हुए कि उनका उपयोग उनके कर्मचारियों द्वारा किया जाता है. उन्होंने ओआरआरसीए से कर्मचारियों को अंतिम-मील कनेक्टिविटी प्रदान करने के लिए इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स सिटी इंडस्ट्रियल टाउनशिप अथॉरिटी (ईएलसीआईटीए) के समान निकटतम मेट्रो स्टेशनों तक बसें संचालित करने का भी आग्रह किया।. अनुचेथ ने कहा, \"एक बार जब केआर पुरम-बयप्पनहल्ली खंड और सिल्क बोर्ड स्टेशन (आरवी रोड-बोम्मसंद्रा) चालू हो जाते हैं, तो ओआरआरसीए और कंपनियां उन जलग्रहण क्षेत्रों की पहचान करने के लिए एक मूल और गंतव्य अध्ययन कर सकती हैं जहां से ये कर्मचारी आ रहे हैं।\". इससे कर्मचारियों के लिए प्रथम-मील, अंतिम-मील कनेक्टिविटी का प्रावधान सक्षम होगा. जबकि केआर पुरम-बयप्पनहल्ली मेट्रो खंड अगस्त-सितंबर 2023 तक चालू होने की उम्मीद है, सिल्क बोर्ड स्टेशन दिसंबर 2023 तक तैयार होने की संभावना है।. दयानंद ने कहा कि बेंगलुरु ट्रैफिक को मैनेज करना एक कठिन काम है. \"हर कोई यातायात प्रबंधन पर अपनी राय रखता है, क्रिकेट विशेषज्ञों की तरह. सार्वजनिक परिवहन को मजबूत करना और पैदल यात्रियों की सुरक्षा सुनिश्चित करना महत्वपूर्ण है. दरअसल, पैदल चलने वालों को दुर्घटनाओं का खतरा अधिक होता है. बीएमटीसी में लगभग 40 लाख दैनिक सवारियां हैं, इसलिए इसे अधिक प्राथमिकता मिलनी चाहिए. शहर की गतिशीलता योजना में विभिन्न एजेंसियां ​​शामिल हैं. उन्होंने तकनीकी कंपनियों को इन्फेंट्री रोड पर यातायात प्रबंधन केंद्र का दौरा करने के लिए भी आमंत्रित किया ताकि वे देख सकें कि वे शहर के यातायात का प्रबंधन कैसे करते हैं. दयानंद ने मनीकंट्रोल को बताया कि ओआरआरसीए और कंपनियों के साथ बातचीत प्रभावी रही. \"प्रमुख मुद्दा यातायात था, लेकिन हमने अपनी योजनाओं के बारे में भी बताया और उनके सुझाव मांगे. हम यातायात को कम करने के लिए विभिन्न पहलों पर भी काम कर रहे हैं।\". ओआरआरसीए टिप्पणी के लिए उपलब्ध नहीं था. 90% साइबर धोखाधड़ी मामलों में तकनीकी विशेषज्ञ पीड़ित हैं: पुलिस इस बीच, व्हाइटफील्ड डिवीजन के पुलिस उपायुक्त एस गिरीश ने कहा, \"90 प्रतिशत से अधिक साइबर धोखाधड़ी मामलों में तकनीकी पेशेवर पीड़ित हैं, जो अधिक जागरूकता की आवश्यकता पर जोर देता है।. हाल ही में एक तकनीकी विशेषज्ञ 1 रुपये की ठगी का शिकार हो गया. 5 करोड़ की साइबर धोखाधड़ी. धोखाधड़ी के उदाहरण, जैसे ओटीपी धोखाधड़ी, अंशकालिक नौकरी घोटाले, ऋण धोखाधड़ी और निवेश धोखाधड़ी, प्रचुर मात्रा में हैं. उन्होंने आगे खुलासा किया कि उन्हें तकनीकी गलियारे की कंपनियों से दोपहिया और लैपटॉप चोरी की कई शिकायतें मिलती हैं. 1996 और 2002 के बीच चरणों में निर्मित, शहर के एक महत्वपूर्ण हिस्से को घेरने वाले 60 किलोमीटर के ओआरआर का उद्देश्य तेज यात्रा के लिए प्रमुख राजमार्गों को जोड़ना और बेंगलुरु में भीड़भाड़ कम करना है।. हालाँकि, ORR का त्रुटिपूर्ण डिज़ाइन, समानांतर सड़कों की अनुपस्थिति के साथ मिलकर, इसका मतलब है कि एक ट्रक का ख़राब होना, पेड़ का गिरना, या जलभराव पूरे तकनीकी गलियारे को ठप कर सकता है।\n",

      "गवर्नर शक्तिकांत दास के नेतृत्व में भारतीय रिजर्व बैंक (आरबीआई) की मौद्रिक नीति समिति (एमपीसी) ने नीतिगत ब्याज दरों को अपरिवर्तित छोड़ने का फैसला किया।. यद्यपि यथास्थिति बाजार की अपेक्षाओं के अनुरूप थी, एमपीसी ने वित्तीय वर्ष के लिए मुद्रास्फीति लक्ष्य बढ़ाने का विकल्प चुना, जिससे निवेशकों की चिंताएं बढ़ सकती हैं।. इस संदर्भ में, विशेषज्ञ अल्पावधि में परिपक्व होने वाले बांड में निवेश करने वाले डेट फंडों में निवेश करने की सलाह देते हैं. मुद्रास्फीति एक प्रमुख चिंता बनी हुई है, हालांकि मुद्रास्फीति घटकर 4 पर आ गई है. मई 2023 में 3 प्रतिशत, जुलाई और अगस्त में मुद्रास्फीति के आंकड़े अधिक होने की उम्मीद है. खाद्य कीमतें एक प्रमुख परिवर्तनशील बनी हुई हैं और मुद्रास्फीति को बढ़ा सकती हैं. अल नीनो के बारिश के वितरण और इसके परिणामस्वरूप कृषि उत्पादन को प्रभावित करने की संभावना से कीमतें और बढ़ सकती हैं. वैश्विक स्तर पर, खाद्य और कच्चे तेल की कीमतें बढ़ी हैं. ब्रेंट कच्चे तेल की कीमत 10 अगस्त, 2023 को 87 डॉलर प्रति बैरल हो गई, जो 31 मई, 2023 को 72 डॉलर प्रति बैरल थी।. ये मुद्रास्फीति के आंकड़ों में बढ़ोतरी की संभावना का संकेत देते हैं. यह भी पढ़ें: आरबीआई की 3 घोषणाएं जो यूपीआई, यूपीआई लाइट को टर्बोचार्ज कर देंगी तदनुसार, आरबीआई ने वित्त वर्ष 2023-2024 के लिए मुद्रास्फीति की उम्मीद को संशोधित कर 5 कर दिया है।. 4 प्रतिशत, जिसे 5 पर निर्धारित किया गया था. जून एमपीसी समीक्षा में 1 प्रतिशत. \"हमें मुद्रास्फीति के मोर्चे पर अर्जुन की तरह नज़र रखते हुए, यदि आवश्यक हो तो नीतिगत उपकरणों को तैनात करते हुए, आगे बढ़ने के लिए तैयार रहना होगा. मैंने अपने जून के नीति वक्तव्य में जो कहा था उसे दोहराता हूं: हेडलाइन मुद्रास्फीति को सहनशीलता बैंड के भीतर लाना पर्याप्त नहीं है; . बैंकिंग प्रणाली में अतिरिक्त तरलता से निपटने के लिए एक अस्थायी उपाय के रूप में, आरबीआई ने अनुसूचित बैंकों को उनकी शुद्ध मांग और समय देनदारियों (एनडीटीएल) में वृद्धि पर 10 प्रतिशत का वृद्धिशील नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (आई-सीआरआर) बनाए रखने का भी निर्देश दिया है। . यह 12 अगस्त, 2023 से शुरू होने वाले पखवाड़े से प्रभावी होगा. इसकी समीक्षा 8 सितंबर, 2023 या उससे पहले की जाएगी. गवर्नर ने आगे कहा कि मौजूदा नकद आरक्षित अनुपात (सीआरआर) 4 पर अपरिवर्तित रहेगा. 5 प्रतिशत और अर्थव्यवस्था की ऋण आवश्यकताओं को पूरा करने के लिए प्रणाली में पर्याप्त तरलता होगी. यह भी पढ़ें: एनआरआई को अपना पैसा निवेश करते समय किन बातों का ध्यान रखना चाहिए इसका डेट फंड निवेशकों पर क्या प्रभाव पड़ता है?

      "जैसे-जैसे भारतीय म्यूचुअल फंड उद्योग में निष्क्रिय निवेश के लिए खरीदारों की संख्या बढ़ रही है, इस क्षेत्र में कुछ दिलचस्प रुझान देखे जा रहे हैं. हालांकि एक्सचेंज-ट्रेडेड फंड (ईटीएफ) संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका में निष्क्रिय निवेश के लिए पसंदीदा माध्यम के रूप में उभरे हैं, भारतीय निवेशक ईटीएफ की तुलना में इंडेक्स फंड के माध्यम से निवेश करने में अधिक सहज हैं।. मोतीलाल ओसवाल एसेट मैनेजमेंट कंपनी (एमओएएमसी) द्वारा किए गए एक सर्वेक्षण के अनुसार, 87 प्रतिशत उत्तरदाता इंडेक्स फंड के माध्यम से निवेश करते हैं, जबकि 42 प्रतिशत उत्तरदाता ईटीएफ के माध्यम से निवेश करते हैं।. एमओएएमसी ने फरवरी-मई 2023 के दौरान ऑनलाइन सर्वेक्षण किया और इसमें देश भर में फैले फंड हाउसों के 2,000 से अधिक निवेशकों को शामिल किया।. लगभग 56 प्रतिशत उत्तरदाता 18-35 वर्ष के आयु वर्ग के थे, जबकि 54 प्रतिशत मेट्रो शहरों में रहते हैं।. इकसठ प्रतिशत उत्तरदाताओं ने बताया कि उनकी वार्षिक आय 10 लाख रुपये से कम है. यह भी पढ़ें: कैसे पूंजी को जोखिम में डाले बिना आवर्ती जमा एक स्मार्ट विकल्प है लगभग 61 प्रतिशत उत्तरदाताओं ने कहा कि उन्होंने कम से कम एक निष्क्रिय फंड में निवेश किया है. निष्क्रिय उत्पादों को चुनने के कारणों के रूप में कम लागत, सादगी और बाजार रिटर्न का हवाला दिया गया. आधे से अधिक उत्तरदाताओं (53 प्रतिशत) ने कहा कि उन्होंने पिछले 12 महीनों में निष्क्रिय निधियों में अपना आवंटन बढ़ाया है. भारत में, म्यूचुअल फंड की इकाइयों (इंडेक्स फंड सहित) की तुलना में ईटीएफ की इकाइयों में निवेश के लिए कोई विशिष्ट तरजीही कर उपचार नहीं है।. कई निवेशकों के पास डीमैट खाते नहीं हैं और ईटीएफ की इकाइयों में लेनदेन करते समय, निवेशकों को खराब तरलता के साथ-साथ उच्च प्रभाव लागत का भी सामना करना पड़ सकता है।. इंडेक्स फंड इन मुद्दों से ग्रस्त नहीं होते हैं और उन निवेशकों के लिए व्यवस्थित निवेश योजनाओं (एसआईपी) की भी अनुमति देते हैं, जो क्रमबद्ध तरीके से निवेश करना चाहते हैं।. मार्च 2023 में, मासिक एसआईपी प्रवाह पहली बार 14,000 करोड़ रुपये के आंकड़े को पार कर गया, जो लगातार 19 महीनों तक 10,000 करोड़ रुपये से ऊपर रहा।. एएमएफआई के आंकड़ों के मुताबिक, जून 2023 में निवेश में एसआईपी का योगदान 14,734 करोड़ रुपये था।. यह भी पढ़ें: म्यूचुअल फंड फोलियो डिकोड: अपने निवेश को प्रभावी ढंग से कैसे सुव्यवस्थित और प्रबंधित करें सर्वेक्षण में उल्लेख किया गया है कि चार में से तीन उत्तरदाता एसआईपी के माध्यम से निवेश करना पसंद करते हैं।. सर्वेक्षण में आगे बताया गया कि 80 प्रतिशत से अधिक उत्तरदाताओं ने अपने निवेश को तीन साल से अधिक समय तक रखने की योजना बनाई है. एमओएएमसी के पैसिव फंड्स के प्रमुख प्रतीक ओसवाल ने कहा, \"पैसिव फंड अमेरिका में व्यापक रूप से लोकप्रिय हैं और उनकी बाजार हिस्सेदारी 50 प्रतिशत से अधिक है।\". पिछले कुछ वर्षों में हमें भारत में भी इसी तरह के रुझान दिखाई देने लगे हैं. लगभग 17 प्रतिशत की बाजार हिस्सेदारी के साथ, हमारा मानना ​​है कि आगे निष्क्रिय फंडों के लिए पर्याप्त संभावनाएं हैं. यह सर्वेक्षण यह जानकारी प्रदान करता है कि निवेशक निष्क्रिय फंडों के बारे में कैसे सोचते हैं. यह भारतीय निवेशकों के निवेश निर्णयों के पीछे की विचार प्रक्रिया पर कुछ प्रकाश डालने में भी मदद करता है. पिछले पांच वर्षों में म्यूचुअल फंड उद्योग में निष्क्रिय फंडों की मांग में वृद्धि देखी गई है. सभी निष्क्रिय फंडों की प्रबंधन के तहत संपत्ति (एयूएम) 31 मार्च, 2023 तक 7 लाख करोड़ रुपये थी, जो पांच साल पहले 83,000 करोड़ रुपये थी, जो 54 प्रतिशत की चक्रवृद्धि वार्षिक वृद्धि दर दर्ज करती है।. ये भी पढ़ें: 1 रुपये में. 85 लाख करोड़, म्यूचुअल फंड में अप्रैल-जून में 4 वर्षों में सबसे अधिक तिमाही प्रवाह देखा गया, इंडेक्स फंड दो दशकों से अधिक समय से भारतीय बाजारों में मौजूद हैं।. हालाँकि, उनके लिए बहुत सारे खरीदार नहीं थे. कर्मचारी भविष्य निधि संगठन (ईपीएफओ) ने वित्त वर्ष 2015-2016 में निफ्टी 50 जैसे मुख्यधारा सूचकांकों पर नज़र रखने वाले ईटीएफ की इकाइयों के माध्यम से शेयरों में निवेश करना शुरू किया।\n",

      "इन दिनों म्यूचुअल फंड (एमएफ) में निवेश करना जितना आसान है, अगर आपके पास बहुत अधिक निवेश और बहुत सारे एमएफ फोलियो हैं तो अपने पोर्टफोलियो पर नज़र रखना काफी मुश्किल काम हो सकता है।. लेकिन इससे बचा जा सकता है अगर आपको पता हो कि अपने एमएफ फोलियो को कैसे प्रबंधित करना है. एमएफ फोलियो क्या है? . एक व्यक्ति के एक बैंक में कई खाते हो सकते हैं. इसी तरह, किसी म्यूचुअल फंड हाउस के पास कई फोलियो हो सकते हैं. म्यूचुअल फंड जीरो-बैलेंस फोलियो की भी अनुमति देते हैं. सीधे शब्दों में कहें तो, यदि आप किसी विशेष फोलियो में रखी गई योजनाओं की सभी इकाइयां बेचते हैं तो यह जीरो-बैलेंस फोलियो बन जाता है. ऐसे फोलियो का इस्तेमाल दोबारा म्यूचुअल फंड स्कीमों में निवेश के लिए किया जा सकता है. प्रत्येक म्यूचुअल फंड हाउस एक अलग फोलियो नंबर जारी करता है. यदि आप अपने निवेश को एक फोलियो के अंतर्गत रखना चाहते हैं, तो बाद के निवेशों के लिए आपको वही फोलियो नंबर उद्धृत करना होगा. अन्यथा, एक अलग फोलियो नंबर जारी किया जाता है. यह भी पढ़ें: वरिष्ठ नागरिकों के लिए एफडी दरें: बैंक जो 9 तक की पेशकश करते हैं. 3-वर्षीय जमा पर 1% ब्याज आजकल, नए म्यूचुअल फंड फोलियो बनाते समय, फंड हाउस निवेश की अनुमति देने से पहले केवाईसी (अपने ग्राहक को जानें) विवरण, संपर्क विवरण और नामांकन मांगता है।. यदि आप इन्हें प्रदान करने में विफल रहते हैं या स्पष्ट रूप से नामांकित व्यक्ति को नियुक्त नहीं करने का विकल्प नहीं चुनते हैं, तो फंड फोलियो नहीं बनाया जा सकता है. चाहे वह पेपर रूट हो या ऑनलाइन रूट, नया फोलियो बनाते समय ये इनपुट जरूरी हैं. लेकिन पहले के दिनों में ऐसा नहीं था. कई बार निवेशकों ने सही जानकारी दर्ज किए बिना ही निवेश शुरू कर दिया. उदाहरण के लिए, कुछ निवेशक वितरकों से संपर्क जानकारी के रूप में वितरकों के मोबाइल नंबर और ईमेल आईडी लिखने के लिए कहते थे. समय के साथ, ऐसी चूकें लेन-देन करने की क्षमता पर प्रतिकूल प्रभाव डाल सकती हैं. उदाहरण के लिए, पोर्टल में लॉगिन करने या लेनदेन को मंजूरी देने के लिए भेजा गया वन-टाइम पासवर्ड (ओटीपी) निवेशक तक नहीं पहुंच सकता है यदि फोन या ईमेल निवेशक का नहीं है।. यह भी पढ़ें: पार्किंसंस, अल्जाइमर रोग से पीड़ित लोगों के लिए एक अलग स्वास्थ्य देखभाल निधि क्यों जरूरी है

था कि क्या उनके फोलियो में दर्ज ईमेल और मोबाइल नंबर उनके या उनके परिवार के सदस्यों के हैं।. यदि आपके पास ऐसे विवरण के बिना पुराने फोलियो हैं, तो आपको उन्हें जल्द से जल्द ठीक करने की आवश्यकता है. समय के साथ, फंड हाउस और रजिस्ट्रार और ट्रांसफर एजेंट (आरटीए) अपने एमएफ निवेश में सीधे रिकॉर्ड स्थापित करने के लिए निवेशकों के संपर्क में आए।. निवेशकों के रूप में, आपको यह सुनिश्चित करना चाहिए कि आपके फोलियो में जानकारी और नामांकन अद्यतित हैं. यदि आपके एमएफ फोलियो में नामांकन नहीं है या आप 30 सितंबर, 2023 से पहले स्पष्ट रूप से इससे बाहर निकलने का विकल्प नहीं चुनते हैं, तो आपको 1 अक्टूबर से ऐसे फोलियो से व्यवस्थित स्थानांतरण योजना या व्यवस्थित निकासी योजना को भुनाने, स्विच करने या पंजीकृत करने की अनुमति नहीं दी जाएगी। . फोलियो का प्रबंधन करना कुछ निवेशक स्वयं प्रत्येक वित्तीय लक्ष्य के लिए अलग-अलग फोलियो बनाना पसंद करते हैं. उदाहरण के लिए, कोई एक फोलियो का उपयोग बच्चे की शिक्षा के लिए और दूसरा सेवानिवृत्ति के वित्तपोषण के लिए कर सकता है. कभी-कभी परिचालन में आसानी के दृष्टिकोण से, अलग-अलग फोलियो की आवश्यकता होती है. किसी के पास एकल-धारक फोलियो और संयुक्त-धारक फोलियो भी हो सकता है. एक संयुक्त-धारक फोलियो के भीतर, पहले धारक सहित अधिकतम तीन निवेशकों को अनुमति है. संयुक्त धारक फोलियो को या तो उत्तरजीवी शासनादेश द्वारा या संयुक्त अधिदेश के साथ संचालित किया जा सकता है. आपके पास कितने फोलियो हो सकते हैं, इस पर कोई प्रतिबंध नहीं है. हालाँकि, आपके लिए ट्रैक करना आसान बनाने के लिए, फोलियो की संख्या न्यूनतम रखें, खासकर फंड हाउसों में. जीईपीएल कैपिटल के प्रमुख-म्यूचुअल फंड, रूपेश भंसाली कहते हैं, \"समेकित खाता विवरण निवेशक को सभी म्यूचुअल फंड निवेशों की सूची में मदद करता है।. आप अपने एमएफ पोर्टफोलियो में छोटी-छोटी होल्डिंग्स भी बेच सकते हैं और प्राप्त रकम को उन योजनाओं में निवेश कर सकते हैं जिनका आपके पोर्टफोलियो में सार्थक भार है।. \"फोलियो को समेकित करते समय होल्डिंग पैटर्न का मिलान होना आवश्यक है. उदाहरण के लिए, केवल उन्हीं फोलियो को समेकित किया जा सकता है जहां यूनिटधारक एकल धारक है. यदि फोलियो संयुक्त नामों में है, तो इसे केवल उसी क्रम में संयुक्त नामों में रखे गए फोलियो के साथ समेकित किया जा सकता है. संयुक्त नाम पर रखे गए फोलियो, मान लीजिए कि ए और बी, को ए के नाम पर रखे गए फोलियो या बी के नाम पर रखे गए फोलियो या बी और ए के नाम पर रखे गए फोलियो के साथ समेकित नहीं किया जा सकता है।. यह भी पढ़ें: आवर्ती जमा (आरडी) जोखिम से बचने वाले निवेशकों के लिए इक्विटी एसआईपी का एक विकल्प प्रदान करता है, मुंबई स्थित वित्तीय नियोजन फर्म मनी मंत्रा के संस्थापक विरल भट्ट

सेवा देने में मदद करता है. चूँकि आपको अपने निवेश के बारे में एक ही दृष्टिकोण मिलता है, आप बेहतर निवेश निर्णय ले सकते हैं. \"डीमैट खाते डीमैट खाते फोलियो के रूप में कार्य करते हैं जब इकाइयां डीमैट खातों में रखी जाती हैं. कई ऑनलाइन प्लेटफ़ॉर्म एकाधिक फोलियो से उत्पन्न होने वाली परेशानी को रोकने के लिए डीमैट खातों में इकाइयाँ रखते हैं. वे ऑनलाइन प्लेटफ़ॉर्म जो म्यूचुअल फंड की इकाइयाँ रखने के लिए डीमैट खातों का उपयोग नहीं करते हैं, निवेशक को मौजूदा फोलियो विवरण दिखाते हैं, जब वह म्यूचुअल फंड की किसी योजना में निवेश करने का विकल्प चुनती है, जहाँ वह पहले से ही निवेश कर रही है।. हालाँकि, यदि आपका वितरक आपको ऐसी सुविधा नहीं दे रहा है या आपके पास कुछ पुराने निवेश हैं या आप कई प्लेटफार्मों पर लेनदेन कर रहे हैं, तो आपको फोलियो की जांच करनी चाहिए और जहां भी लागू हो, अपने संपर्क विवरण और नामांकित व्यक्तियों को जल्द से जल्द अपडेट करना चाहिए।\n",

      "टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस आईपीओ: क्या लॉजिस्टिक्स प्रमुख प्रतिस्पर्धियों से आगे निकल सकता है?\n",
      "लगभग 29 वर्षों के बाद, टीवीएस समूह की कोई कंपनी आरंभिक सार्वजनिक पेशकश (आईपीओ) की ओर बढ़ रही है।. 7 अगस्त को, टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस ने घोषणा की कि उसका आईपीओ 10 अगस्त से 14 अगस्त तक बोली के लिए खुला रहेगा।. सूचीबद्ध होने वाली आखिरी टीवीएस समूह कंपनी 1994 में टीवीएस इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स थी. टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस ने 2004 में एक अलग कंपनी बनने से पहले टीवीएस लॉजिस्टिक्स नाम से समूह के एक हिस्से के रूप में परिचालन शुरू किया।. आज, टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस या टीवीएस एससीएस, एक वैश्विक सप्लाई चेन कंपनी के रूप में, दुनिया भर में फॉर्च्यून 500 कंपनियों को एंड-टू-एंड समाधान प्रदान करती है।. व्यवसाय को दो मुख्य घटकों में विभाजित किया गया है: एकीकृत आपूर्ति श्रृंखला समाधान और नेटवर्क समाधान. यह भी पढ़ें: टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस आईपीओ ने पहली बार 36% बुकिंग दर्ज की। इंटीग्रेटेड सप्लाई चेन सॉल्यूशंस के तहत, कंपनी सोर्सिंग और खरीद, एकीकृत परिवहन, उत्पाद प्रबंधन समाधान, लॉजिस्टिक्स ऑपरेशन सेंटर और इन-प्लांट लॉजिस्टिक्स जैसे तैयार के लिए प्रौद्योगिकी-आधारित समाधान प्रदान करती है। . नेटवर्क सॉल्यूशंस के तहत, यह दो प्रकार की सेवाएं प्रदान करता है: ग्लोबल फ्रेट सॉल्यूशंस और टाइम क्रिटिकल फाइनल माइल सॉल्यूशंस, जिसमें विभिन्न प्रकार की सेवाएं शामिल हैं जैसे कि स्पेयर पार्ट्स लॉजिस्टिक्स सेवाएं, रिटर्न, नवीनीकरण और इंजीनियरिंग सहायता और बी2बी व्यवसायों के लिए कूरियर सेवाएं, दोनों बड़े और . अनुवादित, इसका मतलब यह है कि, एक विनिर्माण कंपनी को, अपने आपूर्तिकर्ताओं और ग्राहकों को पहचानने के बाद, इस बात की चिंता करने की ज़रूरत नहीं है कि चीजों को कैसे आगे बढ़ाया जाए. \"यह पूरे परिचालन को टीवीएस आपूर्ति श्रृंखला को आउटसोर्स कर सकता है, जो दुनिया में कहीं से भी कच्चा माल उठाएगा और उसे कंपनी के कारखानों में पहुंचाएगा, और तैयार माल उठाएगा और अपने ग्राहकों को वितरित करेगा, चाहे वह भारत में हो या . रास्ते में सभी काम, चाहे भंडारण हो या परिवहन के लिए कंटेनर बुक करना हो, या कस्टम क्लीयरेंस का ध्यान रखना हो, कंपनी हर चीज़ का ध्यान रखेगी. अब, हम जानते हैं कि सरकार के जोर और वैश्विक कंपनियों द्वारा चीन से परे अपने सोर्सिंग बेस में विविधता लाने के प्रयास के कारण, भारत में बड़े पैमाने पर निर्यात बढ़ने की संभावना है, जिसे व्यापक रूप से चीन-प्लस-वन रणनीति कहा जाता है।. इसका मतलब स्पष्ट रूप से टीवीएस सप्लाई चेन जैसी कंपनी के लिए अधिक व्यवसाय है. ठोस आधार पर विश्लेषकों का मानना ​​है कि कंपनी के पास एंड-टू-एंड आपूर्ति-श्रृंखला समाधान प्रदान करने की प्रतिस्पर्धी ताकत है. अब तक, कंपनी बड़े पैमाने पर अधिग्रहणों के माध्यम से बढ़ी है, पिछले 17 वर्षों में लगभग 16 अधिग्रहण हुए हैं. इस प्रकार, इसमें डोमेन विशेषज्ञता और वैश्विक उपस्थिति दोनों हैं, जिसका अर्थ है कि यह विभिन्न भौगोलिक क्षेत्रों और उद्योगों में काम करने वाले भविष्य के ग्राहकों के लिए जानकारी को दोहरा सकता है।. वर्तमान में, TVS SCS के ग्राहक यूरोप, एशिया (भारत सहित) और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के 26 देशों में हैं. एचडीएफसी सिक्योरिटीज की एक रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, एकीकृत, डेटा-संचालित, एंड-टू-एंड समाधानों के उपयोग के साथ, कंपनी ग्राहकों को मूल्य प्रदान करने और उनका विश्वास हासिल करने में सक्षम रही है।. इसका मतलब है कि बार-बार आने वाले ग्राहकों की उच्च दर है, जो मौजूदा ग्राहकों से व्यापार का स्थिर प्रवाह सुनिश्चित करती है, भले ही कंपनी नए ग्राहक जोड़ने पर ध्यान केंद्रित करती है।. \"हमारी माप की इकाई एक परियोजना या एक अनुबंध है; हमारे पास कितने अनुबंध हैं, इन अनुबंधों की दीर्घायु क्या है, और हमारी नवीनीकरण क्षमता क्या है... हमारी नवीनीकरण दर लगभग 99 प्रतिशत है, और यह हमारी क्षमता है . हाल ही में, इसने \"आपूर्ति श्रृंखला परिवर्तन\" के लिए यूके स्थित सेंट्रिका पीएलसी को अपने रोस्टर में जोड़ा।. अपने अधिकांश सौदों की तरह, टीवीएस ने 7 साल से अधिक के लिए सेंट्रिका सौदे पर हस्ताक्षर किए. विश्लेषकों का कहना है कि हालांकि टीवीएस के लिए कारोबार का अवसर बहुत बड़ा है और इसके कारोबार की प्रकृति के कारण इसके पास एक अनुकरणीय मॉडल है, लेकिन यह वैश्विक व्यापार में किसी भी प्रतिकूल स्थिति से अछूता नहीं रहेगा।. कोविड काल ने यही दिखाया. कोविड के दौरान, कंपनी का राजस्व मुश्किल से बढ़ा और कारोबार घाटे में चला गया. केवल FY23 में, यह 10,311 रुपये के लाभ के साथ हरे रंग में वापस आ सकता है. 01 करोड़. हालाँकि, बुरे समय में कंपनी के लिए जो चीज़ बचती है, वह तथ्य यह है कि उसके पास एक विविध पोर्टफोलियो है. किसी एक उद्योग या देश में किसी भी मंदी की भरपाई दूसरे उद्योग या देश की वृद्धि से हो सकती है. \"वैश्विक आपूर्ति शृंखला प्रभावित हुई और हमारे कई ग्राहक जैसे इलेक्ट्रॉनिक घटक और ऑटो निर्माता भी प्रभावित हुए. शुक्र है, हमारा पोर्टफोलियो काफी विविध है. इसलिए हम व्यवसाय को प्रभावी ढंग से प्रबंधित करने में सक्षम थे,\" यह कहा. वर्तमान में, टीवीएस एससीएस व्यवसाय का लगभग 50 प्रतिशत विनिर्माण से आता है; . गैर-ऑटो व्यवसायों में इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स, खनन, वैकल्पिक बिजली, प्रौद्योगिकी और उपभोक्ता सामान शामिल हैं, जबकि ऑटो के भीतर यह उत्पादन और उसके बाद के बाजारों दोनों का समर्थन करता है।. \"कई मायनों में, हमारा बिजनेस मॉडल जोखिम रहित है. युद्ध और मुद्रास्फीति के कारण पश्चिमी बाजारों में बहुत मजबूत आर्थिक प्रतिकूल परिस्थितियों के बावजूद, पिछले वित्त वर्ष में हमारा कारोबार बढ़ा,'' प्रबंधन ने हाल ही में मनीकंट्रोल को बताया. पूंजी तीव्रता पिछले तीन वित्तीय वर्षों में, जिसके वित्तीय विवरण उपलब्ध हैं, कंपनी को दो वर्षों में घाटा हुआ. पिछले वित्त वर्ष में इसने 41 रुपये का शुद्ध लाभ दर्ज किया था. 73 रुपये के नुकसान के मुकाबले 7 करोड़ रुपये. FY21 में 9 करोड़. FY23 के लिए EBIDTA मार्जिन 6 रहा. 68 प्रतिशत. 5 पर आरओई के साथ रिटर्न अनुपात भी अप्रभावी था. 50 प्रतिशत और आरओसीई 7 पर. 64 प्रतिशत. इस बिंदु पर वित्तीय आंकड़े बहुत लाभदायक व्यवसाय की ओर इशारा नहीं करते हैं, हालांकि प्रबंधन 'एसेट-लाइट' मॉडल का दावा करता है और कहता है कि वह अगले कुछ वर्षों में दोहरे अंक ईबीआईडीटीए के लिए प्रयास कर रहा है।. संपत्ति-कम होने का मतलब है कि कंपनी के पास अपने किसी भी बेड़े, कंटेनर या गोदाम की जगह नहीं है, यह सब बहुत अच्छा है क्योंकि इसका मतलब है कि व्यवसाय के लिए पूंजी की आवश्यकता बहुत अधिक नहीं है. यह गोदामों और वाहनों को पट्टे पर देता है और क्षमता और बेड़े पर नियंत्रण का पूरा नियंत्रण रखता है. माल की शेड्यूलिंग, रूटिंग, भंडारण और डिलीवरी का प्रबंधन कंपनी द्वारा किया जाता है, जो इसे ग्राहकों की आवश्यकताओं के अनुरूप चीजों को लचीला रखते हुए परिचालन गुणवत्ता मेट्रिक्स पर नियंत्रण बनाए रखने में सक्षम बनाता है।. फिर भी, एसेट-लाइट मॉडल को काफी हद तक एक अच्छे मॉडल के रूप में देखा जाता है, एचडीएफसी सिक्योरिटीज की रिपोर्ट में कहा गया है कि वेयरहाउसिंग और परिवर्तन के लिए तीसरे पक्ष और नेटवर्क भागीदारों पर कंपनी की उच्च निर्भरता, संचालन, वित्तीय और नकदी प्रवाह को प्रभावित कर सकती है।. इसके अलावा, कंपनी का माल ढुलाई, समाशोधन, अग्रेषण और हैंडलिंग शुल्क, और जनशक्ति व्यय (कर्मचारी लाभ व्यय, उप-अनुबंध लागत और आकस्मिक श्रम शुल्क शामिल) इसके परिचालन व्यय का एक महत्वपूर्ण हिस्सा बनाते हैं, जिसका अर्थ है किसी भी आंतरिक या बाहरी कारण से कोई भी वृद्धि . हालाँकि इन्हें आम तौर पर ग्राहकों तक पहुँचाया जाता है, यह हमेशा संभव नहीं हो सकता है, और यह इस पर निर्भर करता है कि अनुबंध में क्या प्रावधान है. एचडीएफसी सिक्योरिटीज द्वारा बताई गई एक और चुनौती विदेशी मुद्रा में इसका एक्सपोजर है. विदेशी मुद्रा में उतार-चढ़ाव से इसके राजस्व और उधार दोनों पर असर पड़ सकता है. भारत में अवसर जबकि इसकी अधिकांश उपस्थिति अंतरराष्ट्रीय है, भारत में बढ़ते आपूर्ति श्रृंखला बाजार और इसके आकार के बड़े पैमाने के खिलाड़ी की अनुपस्थिति घरेलू बाजार में टीवीएस एससीएस के लिए फायदेमंद हो सकती है, और अधिकांश विश्लेषकों का मानना ​​​​है कि यही कारण है . वर्तमान में, भारत में थर्ड-पार्टी लॉजिस्टिक्स बाज़ार का एक बड़ा हिस्सा अत्यधिक अव्यवस्थित है. फिस्डोम के अनुसंधान प्रमुख, नीरव करकेरा ने कहा, \"टीवीएस एससीएस के पास बड़े संस्थागत ग्राहकों, पैमाने और विस्तार की बढ़त है और एंड-टू-एंड समाधान प्रदान करने की क्षमता है जो कोई अन्य कंपनी नहीं करती है।\". इसके निश्चित रूप से अपने फायदे हैं, जिसमें आपूर्ति श्रृंखला प्रक्रिया में विभिन्न बिंदुओं पर तालमेल बनाने में आसानी भी शामिल है. \"वास्तव में, भारत में लॉजिस्टिक्स उद्योग अनुकूल व्यापक आर्थिक कारकों, भारतीय लॉजिस्टिक्स क्षेत्र में आउटसोर्सिंग की वृद्धि और विनिर्माण और खपत को प्रोत्साहित करने वाली सरकारी नीतियों जैसे वित्त वर्ष 2022 से 13 प्रतिशत की सीएजीआर पर वित्त वर्ष 2027 तक 385 बिलियन डॉलर तक बढ़ने की उम्मीद है। . पिछले कुछ वर्षों में, वैश्विक कंपनियों की चीन प्लस वन रणनीति के आधार पर, सरकार घरेलू विनिर्माण को प्रोत्साहित कर रही है. विश्लेषकों का मानना ​​है कि यह इस क्षेत्र के लिए अतिरिक्त लाभ हो सकता है. फोकस में आईपीओ टीवीएस एससीएस ने शुरुआत में पिछले साल आईपीओ लाने के अपने इरादे की घोषणा की थी, लेकिन यह बताया गया कि बाजार की स्थितियों और निवेशकों की भावनाओं को ध्यान में रखते हुए इसे स्थगित कर दिया गया था।. आईपीओ के माध्यम से, कंपनी, जिसका मूल्य 9,200 करोड़ रुपये है, पहले से तय किए गए 2,000 करोड़ रुपये के मुकाबले नए इश्यू से लगभग 600 करोड़ रुपये जुटाने की योजना बना रही है।. कंपनी के अनुसार, जुटाई गई धनराशि कर्ज से जुड़ी पिछली चुनौतियों से उबरने में मदद करने में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाएगी. इसी तरह, उसने अपनी बिक्री पेशकश को घटाकर 14 कर दिया है. पहले नियोजित 59 मिलियन शेयरों में से 23 मिलियन शेयर. इसकी आरंभिक सार्वजनिक पेशकश के लिए निर्धारित मूल्य दायरा 187-197 रुपये है. निर्गम मूल्य के उच्च अंत पर, कंपनी का बाजार पूंजीकरण 8,750 करोड़ रुपये है. इश्यू की कीमत 10 है. 18 रुपये के शुद्ध संपत्ति मूल्य के आधार पर 5 गुना. मार्च 2023 तक 89. टीवीएस समूह, जिसे एक शेयरधारक-अनुकूल समूह के रूप में देखा जाता है, और जबरदस्त विकास के अवसर के साथ कंपनी की वंशावली को ध्यान में रखते हुए, स्टॉक में विकास की लहर पर चढ़ने और लंबी अवधि में धन बनाने की क्षमता है।. लेकिन अल्प से मध्यम अवधि में, यह कोई बढ़िया दांव नहीं हो सकता है. करकेरा का कहना है कि उन्हें बड़े संस्थागत निवेशकों के बीच इस स्टॉक के लिए अच्छी संभावनाएं दिखती हैं. उन्होंने कहा, \"यह क्षेत्र बहुत अधिक संस्थागत हित की गारंटी देता है और ये निवेशक इस क्षेत्र पर दीर्घकालिक जोखिम लेने को तैयार हैं जो विस्तार मोड में है।\"\n",

. \"हम वैश्विक गेमिंग और प्रौद्योगिकी उद्योग में एक प्रमुख खिलाड़ी के रूप में भारत की क्षमता में दृढ़ता से विश्वास करते हैं. हम न केवल गेमिंग और तकनीकी उद्योग में बल्कि व्यापक सामग्री परिदृश्य में भी परिवर्तनकारी प्रभाव डालने के लिए समर्पित हैं\" सोहन ने कहा. उन्होंने कहा कि क्राफ्टन का इरादा 150 मिलियन डॉलर के कोष में से कम से कम एक तिहाई मौजूदा कंपनियों को उनकी भविष्य की विकास पहल के लिए आवंटित करने का है, और एक तिहाई गहरी तकनीकी कंपनियों को आवंटित करने का है जो उपभोक्ताओं को अलग सेवाएं और पेशकश प्रदान कर सकें।. उन्होंने कहा, शेष एक-तिहाई अन्य नए स्टार्टअप की ओर जाएगा. \"हम विकास चरण के निवेशक के रूप में उतने परिपक्व नहीं हैं, लेकिन शुरुआती चरण के निवेशक के रूप में भी नहीं. हम खुद को इस तरह के क्षेत्र में स्थापित कर रहे हैं जहां स्टार्टअप ने उत्पाद बाजार में फिट साबित कर दिया है, और राजस्व में बढ़ोतरी शुरू हो गई है, लेकिन विकास को गति देने के लिए उन्हें बड़े पैमाने पर फंडिंग की जरूरत है\" सोहन ने कहा. उन्होंने कहा, उन्होंने बताया कि वे नए सौदों को लेकर चयनात्मक हैं क्योंकि वे संस्थापकों के साथ संबंध रखना पसंद करते हैं और किसी कंपनी में निष्क्रिय निवेशक नहीं हैं।. उन्होंने कहा, \"हम आम तौर पर कंपनी में कम से कम 10% हिस्सेदारी रखना पसंद करते हैं और फिर हम बोर्ड में बैठना चाहते हैं, हम उन्हें सलाह देने और नए व्यवसाय विकास के अवसरों को पेश करने के मामले में अधिक सक्रिय होना चाहते हैं।\". क्राफ्टन, जो पहले से ही लुमिकाई और 3one4 कैपिटल जैसे शुरुआती चरण के उद्यम पूंजी फंड में निवेश कर चुका है, वर्तमान में देश में इसी तरह के वीसी फंड निवेश के अवसरों की तलाश कर रहा है, सोहन ने कहा. इस सप्ताह की शुरुआत में, जापानी मोबाइल मनोरंजन दिग्गज मिक्सी ने भारत के बाजार को समर्पित 50 मिलियन डॉलर का कॉर्पोरेट उद्यम पूंजी कोष भी लॉन्च किया. यह फंड देश में गेमिंग, डिजिटल मनोरंजन और उपभोक्ता सेवा क्षेत्र में शुरुआती चरण के स्टार्टअप को समर्थन देगा. इस बीच, लुमिकाई ने देश में शुरुआती चरण के गेमिंग और इंटरैक्टिव मीडिया स्टार्टअप को समर्थन देने के लिए $50 मिलियन जुटाने के उद्देश्य से जून 2023 में अपना दूसरा फंड लॉन्च किया।. इसने घरेलू रुपया पूंजी को आकर्षित करने के लिए भारतीय सीमित भागीदारों के लिए एक समर्पित 10 मिलियन डॉलर का एआईएफ (वैकल्पिक निवेश कोष) भी स्थापित किया।. इससे लुमिकाई की कुल प्रबंधनाधीन संपत्ति (एयूएम) 100 मिलियन डॉलर हो जाएगी. यह भी पढ़ें | . महाद्वीप में वीडियो गेम, ई-स्पोर्ट्स और स्ट्रीमिंग को कवर करने वाली मार्केट रिसर्च और कंसल्टिंग फर्म निको पार्टनर्स के अनुसार, 2022 में 5 मिलियन. यह 21 की पांच साल की चक्रवृद्धि वार्षिक वृद्धि दर से बढ़ने के लिए तैयार है. $1 को छूने के लिए 1 प्रतिशत. 2026 में 4 बिलियन. इसमें वास्तविक धन खेलों से उत्पन्न राजस्व शामिल नहीं है. फर्म ने कहा कि भारत में लगभग 34 प्रतिशत गेमर्स ने 2022 में गैर-आरएमजी टाइटल पर पैसा खर्च किया।. भारत के समग्र गेमिंग उद्योग का राजस्व वित्त वर्ष 2011 में 2 बिलियन डॉलर से बढ़कर 2 डॉलर हो गया. वित्त वर्ष 2012 में 6 बिलियन और 27 प्रतिशत की चक्रवृद्धि वार्षिक वृद्धि दर से $8 तक बढ़ने की उम्मीद है. लुमिकाई की एक रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, FY27 में 6 बिलियन. भारत के वीडियो गेमिंग बाजार का एक त्वरित स्नैपशॉट, भारत के गेम्स पोर्टफोलियो का विस्तार क्राफ्टन ने हाल ही में डिफेंस डर्बी के लॉन्च के साथ देश में गेम्स के अपने पोर्टफोलियो का विस्तार किया, जो कि उसके स्वतंत्र स्टूडियो राइजिंगविंग्स द्वारा विकसित एक वास्तविक समय रणनीति गेम है।. इस लॉन्च के साथ, क्राफ्टन अब भारत में चार टाइटल पेश करता है जिसमें बीजीएमआई के अलावा एक वास्तविक समय रणनीति गेम रोड टू वेलोर: एम्पायर और एक बैटल रॉयल गेम न्यू स्टेट मोबाइल शामिल है।. \"जो मेट्रिक्स हम भारतीय गेमर्स से देख रहे हैं, वे वैश्विक गेमर्स से बहुत अलग हैं. यह एक कठिन यात्रा है\" सोहन ने कहा. उदाहरण के लिए, सोहन ने कहा कि कुछ गेम जिन्होंने अन्य बाजारों में काफी अच्छा काम किया है, जरूरी नहीं कि वे भारत में भी उसी तरह काम करें।. \"मुझे लगता है कि भारतीय लोग थोड़े रूढ़िवादी हैं या नए गेमप्ले या नई शैली से कम परिचित हैं. मेरी विनम्र राय में, भारतीय लोग अपना अधिकांश गेमिंग समय लूडो या किसी प्रकार के कार्ड और बोर्ड गेम और बीजीएमआई या अन्य बैटल रॉयल गेम्स में बिताते हैं।. ये गेम यहां लोगों के गेमिंग समय का 50 प्रतिशत से अधिक खर्च कर सकते हैं. लेकिन मेरा मानना ​​है कि रणनीति गेम, रेसिंग गेम में बहुत संभावनाएं हैं\" हालांकि वे एक वैश्विक गेमिंग कंपनी हैं, सोहन ने कहा कि उनका इरादा एक स्थानीय प्रकाशक बनने का है जो \"भारत से वैश्विक गेम या नए गेम ला सके जो गेमर्स के लिए आंखें खोल सकें. यह रातोरात काम नहीं कर सकता लेकिन हम सीखना जारी रखेंगे\"\n",

      "Ola reports consolidated revenue of Rs 1,970 crore; losses mount to Rs 1,522 crore\n",
      "ANI Technologies-owned Ola on August 9 reported a consolidated revenue of Rs 1,970.42  crore during the financial year 2022 (FY22), up nearly 100 percent year-on-year (YoY), showed filings sourced from the Registrar of Companies (RoC).  In FY21, Ola reported a consolidated revenue of Rs 983 crore.  The company reported a consolidated loss of Rs 1,522.3 crore in FY22, up by around 36.3 percent YoY mainly on account of a rise in its overall expenses. In FY21 Ola reported a loss of Rs 1,116 crore.  The firm's total expenses were at around Rs 3,362 crore, up by around 67.5 percent year on year.  Ola's employee benefit expense which includes expenses such as salaries and wages, contribution to Provident Fund, and staff welfare was recorded at Rs 552 crore in FY22 as against Rs 436 crore in FY21.  ANI Technologies operates multiple subsidiaries including Ola Electric, Pickup.ai, Ola Fleet Technologies, Ola Financial Services and outside India operations like Ola Singapore Pte Ltd and in other regions including the USA and France.  Its EV subsidiary, Ola Electric, recorded an operating loss of $136 million on a revenue of $335 million in the last FY22 which concluded in March, as per a Reuters report.  The losses reported by the startup also come at a time when its investors are marking down their fair value of Ola.  On August 1, Vanguard cut the fair value of ANI Technologies, the parent company of ride-hailing platform Ola, for the second time in three months, effectively valuing it at less than half of its previous valuation.  Vanguard, which holds 166,185 shares of Ola or about 0.7 percent stake in the company, has pegged the fair value of its stake at $25,038,000, down from its acquisition cost of $51,748,000, the AMC's regulatory filings showed.  Uber India, which directly competes with Ola's cab aggregation business, reported a rise in revenue of 7 percent to Rs 396.5 crore. Uber's total loss fell to Rs 216.42 crore, from Rs 333.89 crore in FY21.\n",

      "Edtech startup Saarthi initiates legal actions against ClassPlus over troubled acquisition\n",
      "The founder and investors of Saarthi have initiated legal actions against Classplus, an edtech startup, almost a year after the latter was to acquire the former.  Chirag Kapil, founder of Saarthi along with investors said they have filed a criminal complaint against Classplus and its founders, Mukul Rustagi and Bhaswat Agarwal. While the names of investors who have filed the complaint against Classplus have not been disclosed, its prominent investors include Pinnacle Investments and GVFL Ltd.  Classplus' Chief Financial Officer Sankalp Aggarwal has also been named as an accused.  Saarthi said complaints stemmed from the acquisition that did not progress as planned. The lawsuit contains a comprehensive list of grave allegations, which include cheating, extortion, criminal breach of trust, mental harassment, defamation, theft of immovable property, misappropriation of funds, and more, Saarthi said in a press statement on August 9.  Founded in 2018 by Rustagi and Agarwal, Classplus is a mobile-first software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that allows educators and content creators to build their online presence, digitise their offline tuition centres and sell courses online.  Also read: Classplus is overvalued, Unacademy's Gaurav Munjal says citing Graphy's growth  The controversy traces back to late 2021 when the founders of Saarthi and Classplus first engaged. In October of that year, an acquisition proposal was presented, with seemingly advantageous terms for Saarthi.  The talks began in 2011 and as per the deal, business operations and employees from Saarthi would be moved to Classplus. While initially, Saarthi's Kapil took up an executive role at Classplus, the company said matters started to go downhill from there when Kapil's role was terminated.  \"Furthermore, investors associated with Saarthi have not received their stipulated agreements or the corresponding equity they were entitled to. Both Kapil and the aggrieved investors have lodged legal and criminal complaints, naming Classplus and its founders, Mukul Rustagi and Bhaswat Agarwal, along with the Chief Financial Officer, Sankalp Aggarwal, as the responsible parties,\" the company statement said.  Tiger Global-backed Classplus was valued at over $600 million in 2022 and sells software to educators and coaching centres, among others.  Classplus is also backed by Peak XV's Surge, Blume Ventures, Alpha Wave, and GSV Ventures.  Both Saarthi and Classplus have submitted their responses in the Delhi High Court, and the next hearing is scheduled for September.\n",

      "Credgenics, a startup offering debt collection software to banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), has raised $50 million in its Series B funding round led by WestBridge Capital and Accel Partners, bucking the slowdown in funding activity.  The round also saw participation from Tanglin Ventures, Beams Fintech Fund and other strategic investors.  The company plans to use the funds for product innovation, international business expansion and entering other banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) industry segments, it said in a statement on August 9.  \"With these resources, we can extend our innovative debt recovery solutions to new markets, empowering individuals and businesses worldwide to regain control of their loan collections,\" cofounder Rishabh Goel said.

Founded in 2019 by Goel, Anand Agrawal and  Mayank Khera, Credgenics is a provider of loan collections and debt-resolution technology platforms to banks, NBFCs and fintechs across the globe.

The company was valued at $100 million in the Series A round.  \"With AI at its forefront, what Credgenics is doing is truly exceptional.

      "Why L&amp;T's AM Naik chose to be a manager and not an entrepreneur\n",
      "Anil Manibhai Naik (81), the Non-Executive Chairman of Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;amp;T), said he is not mentally geared for starting anything small, looking back at his six-decade-long career leading the construction behemoth.  Talking exclusively to Moneycontrol ahead of his last annual general meeting (AGM), he said that when he decided to start an IT business, which was completely different from L&amp;amp;T's core business, he had the company's backing.  \"If I had to start IT on my own, I would have to create a small start-up, and I am not mentally geared for starting anything small; anything less than a billion is not on my mind,\" Naik told Moneycontrol in a recent interview.  Naik said that while ownership has not been an aspiration for him for the longest time, keeping him away from the entrepreneurial journey, the many hospitals and schools that he has set up give him the satisfaction of creating something.  Also read: MC Interview | India needs to focus on speed and scale; hopeful of L&amp;amp;T's future: Chairman AM Naik  One of the tallest leaders of India Inc, Naik has been credited with single-handedly growing L&amp;amp;T and shielding it from takeover bids. He has been the mastermind behind the many diversifications of the $23-billion engineering major.  Naik said he was unstirred in the face of such challenges, for, he said, they were a driving force throughout his career.  \"The most challenging times were 2003 and 2004. Did that give me sleepless nights? Maybe one or two nights would go sleepless, but otherwise, I slept well because I looked at every challenge as a hobby and I enjoyed it. Without challenges, I am a little unhappy, and I get tense,\" he said.  Naik, who chose to become a manager over an entrepreneur, advises start-up founders not to rush into their ventures, as haste may lead to failure.  \"In general, I want to advise them not to rush into anything just because they want to be another billionaire. Everyone doesn't become a billionaire; eight out of 10 may not succeed. They don't succeed because they rush without proper study on what they are starting and how they can stand up to others who are anyway doing the same thing in South America, China, Japan, or the US,\" Naik told Moneycontrol.  Naik was born on June 9, 1942, in Gujarat. He holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya Engineering College, Gujarat. His father, Manibhai Nichhabhai Naik, was a freedom fighter who quit his job in a Mumbai school to contribute to rural India.  \"I was not an IIT graduate because my father went to a village, but destiny brought me to L&amp;amp;T. I believe the best students of second-level colleges are better than the bottom quadrant of first-level colleges,\" said Naik.  According to the L&amp;amp;T head, the company also largely depends on training talent from mid-tier engineering colleges and not &lsquo;flying engineers who will go to other industries.' Naik said that today, the whole industry has sourced professionals from L&amp;amp;T.  The L&amp;amp;T chief, who has been made Chairman Emeritus, pegs L&amp;amp;T's next phase of growth on its talent, leadership, and entrepreneurial thinking.  \"When the opportunities come, we must know which one to pick. We should never do anything that will be less than $1 billion, even if it looks small now. Scale and speed will be important. You must create a size that is economically viable and make sure that you are ahead of the competition,\" Naik added.\n",

      "SoftBank invests most in four quarters, restarts &lsquo;careful' investments with focus on AI\n",
      "SoftBank Group Corp invested the most in four quarters, transitioning its strategy from a defensive to an offensive approach with an increased focus on artificial intelligence (AI) amid a rebound in shares of technology companies globally.  SoftBank, on a group level, invested $1.8 billion in the three months to June, most since April-June last year, when it invested about $2.5 billion, its Chief Financial Officer, Yoshimitsu Goto said during the earnings presentation on August 8.  Through the company's Vision Fund Unit, which includes the two Vision Funds and one Latin America Fund, SoftBank invested $900 million, more than two times compared to the same quarter of last year, when it invested about $400 million.  \"We have been carefully, carefully restarting our investment activities. I hope you get the sensitivity here that we are carefully and slowly moving back to investment activities,\" said Goto.  \"The investments that we have done so far, have been selectively considered and at the same time with a focus on the AI trend. For future growth, we would like to start having a good relationship with those companies that we hope are the future of the group,\" he added.  Goto's talk commenced with a slide labelled \"signs of change,\" where he delved into the surge observed in technology stocks recently. This surge brought about a reason for celebration at SoftBank, known for its investments in tech enterprises. Another slide, titled \"shifting to offence,\" was presented. Nevertheless, Goto's demeanour did not exude a high level of confidence as he continued saying that the company would take a very careful approach when it comes to investments.  Goto also emphasised how SoftBank's portfolio companies across sectors such as frontier tech, edtech, health tech, logistics, proptech and fintech among others, could potentially use generative AI. For instance, he said Delhivery, a logistics unicorn, could use generative AI for route optimisation.  SoftBank's positive outlook on AI and the gradual resurgence of investor interest are set to ignite hope within the realm of Indian startups. This resurgence hints at the potential return of one of the country's most assertive late-stage investors, which had refrained from investments for a span of 15 months.  India stands as SoftBank's third-largest market, trailing only the US and China. Nonetheless, Navneet Govil, a top executive in the Vision Funds unit, emphasised that the bar for investment is \"very high.\"  SoftBank, one of the most active tech investors in the world, has been reporting a loss for three consecutive quarters. However, its loss narrowed significantly in the June quarter to $3.3 billion, thanks to its Vision Fund investment unit, through which it makes investments in high-growth technology companies across the globe, making a gain on investments during the period, for the first time after five quarters.  Between the two segments of the Vision Fund investment units, the fair valuation of SoftBank's portfolio companies listed on the market rose from $24.9 billion as of March 31, 2023, to reach $25.4 billion by the close of the June quarter.  Concurrently, the fair value of SoftBank's private portfolio companies, which constitute a substantial portion of their investments, witnessed a marginal increase to $61.3 billion by June 30, as opposed to $60.5 billion in the previous quarter.  While SoftBank has not participated in any investments in India this year, the Japanese investor has been paring stakes in public companies like Paytm (One97 Communications) and private startups like Lenskart.  In fact, Paytm, one of SoftBank's biggest investments in India, turned breakeven for the Japanese investor, for the first time since its listing in November 2021 following a sharp rally in its stock, Moneycontrol reported in July. SoftBank is also looking at paring its stake in food tech unicorn Zomato via open-market transactions, thanks to the company's share price also rising due to improved financial performance.\n",

      "ZestMoney gets a lifeline, existing investors infuse capital\n",
      "Fintech firm ZestMoney's existing investors such as Quona Capital, Omidyar Network India, Flourish Ventures, Zip, and Scarlet Capital have pumped in funds, months after its sale fell through and the founders exited the firm.  The fresh capital infusion will give the embattled buy now pay later startup, bereft of funding and founders, a much-needed lifeline, as it aims to become profitable.  \"The new funding will support the business as it drives towards profitability, and the company's investors, made up of leading international and Indian fintech investors, are excited about its next chapter,\" the company said in a prepared statement on Tuesday.  Talking about the runway available for ZestMoney, the statement said that it gave enough funding to get to profitability soon.  \"Anything more is welcome to further drive our growth moving forward. The current round raised in such a funding environment for the fintech sector globally is a testament to both the Zest model and the market opportunity,\" the statement said.  During an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Lizzie Chapman, cofounder of ZestMoney said that the existing investors will pump funds into the business.  \"The investors, as I said, have been mostly working on this idea for an internal round and working on getting alignment among all the investors,\" Chapman said.  The firm did not disclose the funding size, however, sources told Moneycontrol that it was between $5 million and $10 million.  &amp;nbsp;  In Macrch, Walmart-backed PhonePe called off its deal with ZestMoney over due diligence concerns that led to a huge setback for the BNPL platform.  According to media reports, PhonePe would have paid $200-300 million to ZestMoney if the deal had gone through, much less than BNPL firm's last valuation of $470 million.  ZestMoney had been looking for a buyer for at least a year now as it has struggled to raise funds, according to multiple sources. The unsuccessful deal coupled with RBI's stringent regulations on BNPL businesses led to financial troubles within ZestMoney.  Founded in 2016 by Lizzie Chapman, Priya Sharma and Ashish Anantharaman, ZestMoney has a customer base of 17 million and enables loan disbursals of Rs 400 crore per month. The company has 27 lending partners and merchant partnerships with 10,000 online brands and 75,000 offline stores.  In May of 2023, all the founders of ZestMoney resigned and a new leadership team was formed with Abhishek Sharma as the head of growth, Mandar Satupte as chief banking officer, and Mohit Chhajer as the vice-president of finance and financial operations (FinOps).  \"This capital-combined with the unwavering commitment of our more than 150-strong team-enables us to successfully serve our consumers, merchants, and lender partners, while continuing to keep non-payment rates at under 2.5 percent in the largest and fastest-growing EMI market globally,\" said Sharma, ZestMoney's newly appointed CEO.  ZestMoney had in September 2022 raised $50 million from Australian BNPL fintech Zip Co. This is a part of a larger Series C fundraise which will see participation from existing investors like Goldman Sachs, Quona Capital, Xiaomi and Alteria Capital.\n",

      "Axis Securities report on Britannia Industries BRIT Q1FY24 Results were below our estimates on account of flat volume growth and lower-than-expected gross and EBITDA margins expansion. Moreover, competition intensified amidst the lower raw material prices. However, the management has guided volume recovery in FY24 on account of rural expansion, increase grammage, and price cuts. EBITDA margins are likely to remain at the current level and the management does not expect meaningful recovery owing to price cuts along with higher ad-spends and increased start-up costs on account of continued capacity expansion in the company's existing plants (Ranjangaon &ndash; Dairy expansion, Bihar and Orissa) &bull; Though Q1FY24 results were below our estimates, we believe the worst is behind for the company as 1) Raw material prices of palm and packaging costs are in a downward trajectory (though they are still firm for wheat and sugar prices), 2) Ruralled distribution expansion and focused approached in Hindi belt region is expected to help the company gain market share, and 3) Rural revival is expected in the coming quarters, supporting recovery. Moreover, BRIT's long-term prospects remain strong as the management has a proven execution track record, robust portfolio planning through NPD in core and adjacencies, and a focus on continued distribution expansion in direct as well as rural markets. Outlook Based on the above thesis, we estimate Revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 11%/12%/13% over FY23-26E and maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a revised TP to Rs 5,110/share vs. the TP of Rs 5,300/share earlier.

Decline in revenues was largely on the back of a) decline in RM cost resulting into lower subsidy income from the Govt. and b) lower sales volumes in Non-urea traded fertilizers (down 29% YoY). Gross margins improved by 630bps YoY to 34.9% primarily led by lower RM cost, while higher employee cost and other expenses up 40bps/290bps YoY respectively has restricted EBITDA margins improvement to 320bps YoY to 11.3% (PLe 9.8%). PAT was up 6% YoY to Rs3.3bn. Going forward, management alluded that most provisions for high cost inventory are largely behind, however they remained cautious on further cut in subsidy rates during 2HFY24. Outlook Further, robust subsidy disbursement from Govt. till YTDFY24 coupled with falling RM cost scenario will likely keep working capital at comfortable levels along with healthy balance sheet.

BYRCS reported decent set of numbers with revenue growth of 4% YoY (adjusted for effect of customer incentive programs growth was 9% YoY), mainly driven by strong sales in Crop Protection (CP) (despite expected moderation in Round-up (Glyphosate) sales due to lower realizations) and strong volume growth in corn hybrid seeds. We believe strong growth witnessed in corn hybrid seeds was largely led by better corn acreages in the ongoing kharif season (up 1% YoY as on 4th August'23) supported by remunerative corn prices (up 8% YoY to Rs2,295/quintal as on July'23). Pricing pressure in Round-up (Glyphosate) coupled with high cost inventory provisions in CP segment likely to have dent gross margins (down 580bps YoY) to 42.7%.

      "The Indian rupee dropped to one-month low against the US dollar in the opening trade on August 2 amid rising crude prices and weak Asian currencies. A growing dollar demand and concerns over foreign outflows amid volatile local equities added to the weakness.  Global markets fell as negative sentiment after credit rating agency Fitch Ratings downgraded the US credit rating from AAA to AA+. This decision was driven by concerns over the anticipated fiscal deterioration in the US economy over the next three years.  At 11.07 am, the rupee was trading at 82.48 a dollar, down 0.16 percent from its previous close. The currency hit a low of 82.49 -- a level last seen on 10 July.  Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on August 2, trading near their highest since April after industry data showed a steeper-than-expected draw last week in oil inventories in the US, the world's biggest fuel consumer, news agency Reuters reported.  Foreign investors have sold shares worth Rs 5,700 crore over the past four sessions.  \"(The rupee weakened) due to rising dollar demand as concerns start to brew over the possibility of potential outflows of Russian funds held in rupees with local banks,\" CR Forex said in its latest note.  Amid the Western sanctions that restrict Russia from using the US dollar for trade, India paid in other currencies, including the dirham, yuan, and rupee, which local banks hold in special accounts, it said.  However, since Indian imports exceeded exports, Russian companies accumulated billions of rupees that the RBI has allowed to be invested in local government bonds. \"Well, the markets have been worried about the eventual outflows of these funds which could lead to a rise in FX volatility\", the report added.  Asian currencies were trading weak against the dollar as well.

The crude oil, which was trading above $80 a barrel also dampened sentiments among traders.  Overnight, as expected, the European Central Bank (ECB) hiked the interest rate by 25 bps, thus bringing the deposit rate to 3.75 percent.

Despite the overall hawkish tone of the statement, chairman Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference leaned slightly towards the dovish side.

      "What Benjamin Franklin Learned While Fighting Counterfeiters\n",
      "When Benjamin Franklin moved to Philadelphia in 1723, he got to witness the beginning of a risky new experiment: Pennsylvania had just begun printing words on paper and calling it money.  The first American paper money had hit the market in 1690. Metal coins never stayed in the 13 colonies long, flowing in a ceaseless stream to England and elsewhere, as payment for imported goods. Several colonies began printing bits of paper to stand in for coins, stating that within a certain time period, they could be used locally as currency. The system worked, but haltingly, the colonies soon discovered. Print too many bills, and the money became worthless. And counterfeiters often found the bills easy to copy, devaluing the real stuff with a flood of fakes.  Franklin, who started his career as a printer, was an inveterate inventor who would also create the lightning rod and bifocals, found paper money fascinating. In 1731, he won the contract to print 40,000 pounds for the colony of Pennsylvania, and he applied his penchant for innovation to currency.  During his printing career, Franklin produced a stream of baroque, often beautiful money. He created a copper plate of a sage leaf to print on money to foil counterfeiters: The intricate pattern of veins could not easily be imitated. He influenced a number of other printers and experimented with producing new paper and concocting inks.  Now, in a study published earlier this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of physicists has revealed new details about the composition of the ink and paper that Franklin used, raising questions about which of his innovations were intended as defenses against counterfeiting and which were simply experiments with new printing techniques.  The study draws on more than 600 artifacts held by the University of Notre Dame, said Khachatur Manukyan, a physicist at that institution and an author of the new paper. He and his colleagues looked at 18th century American currency using Raman spectroscopy, which uses a laser beam to identify specific substances - such as silicon or lead - based on their vibration. They also used a variety of microscopy techniques to examine the paper on which the money was printed.  Some of what they observed confirms what historians have long known: Franklin's paper money contains flecks of mica, also known as muscovite or isinglass. These shiny patches were most likely an attempt to combat counterfeiters, who would not have had access to this special paper, said Jessica Linker, a professor of American history at Northeastern University who studies paper money of this era and was not involved in the study. Of course, that didn't stop them from trying.  \"They come up with very good counterfeits, with mica pasted to the surface,\" Linker said.  In the new study, the researchers found that the mica in bills for different colonies seems to have come from the same geological source, suggesting that a single mill produced the paper. The Philadelphia area is notable for its schist, a flaky mineral that contains mica; it's possible that Franklin or printers and papermakers associated with him collected the substance used in their paper locally, Manukyan said.  When they examined the black ink on some of the bills, however, the scientists were surprised to find that it appeared to contain graphite. For most printing jobs, Franklin tended to use black ink made from burned vegetable oils, known as lampblack, said James Green, librarian emeritus of the Library Company of Philadelphia. Graphite would have been hard to find, he suspects.  \"So Franklin's use of graphite in money printing is very surprising, and his use on bills printed as early as 1734 is even more surprising,\" Green said in an email.  Could using graphite ink have been a way to differentiate real money from fakes? Differences in color between graphite and lampblack are likely to have been subtle enough to make that a difficult task, Green said. Instead, we may be looking at another example of Franklin's creativity.  \"It suggests to me that almost from the start, he was using his money printing contracts as an opportunity to experiment with an array of new printing techniques,\" he said.  To understand more clearly Franklin's intent, more analyses of printed documents from the era would be helpful, said Joseph Adelman, a professor of history at Framingham State University in Massachusetts.  \"The comparison I would most like to see would be Franklin's other publications,\" Adelman said. \"To really test this theory - does Franklin have this separate store of ink?\"  In future research, Manukyan hopes to collaborate with scholars who have access to larger collections of early American paper money. These techniques can be quite valuable in the study of history, Linker said, if scientists and historians can work together to identify the best questions to answer.  \"I have questions about a whole bunch of inks. There's a really weird green on some of the New Jersey bills,\" she said, referring to money printed by a Franklin contemporary. \"I would love to know what that green ink was made of.\"  (Author: Veronique Greenwood)/(c.2021 The New York Times Company)\n",

      "Internationalising INR: Local currency swap deals with trade partners can provide a boost\n",
      "No matter how well articulated the logic is, central bankers always have a tinge of conservativeness; the recently released Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) report of RBI on the internationalisation of the Indian rupee (INR) is no exception. The developments in the currency front cannot be studied in isolation, these are interlinked with the progress of the external sector and the composition of GDP growth. Over the last three decades not only our trade linkages with the world have increased, funds flow has gone up too. On the currency front, there are mixed signals, as a reserve currency the dominance of US dollars is on the wane. Yet, the dollar's share in foreign exchange turnover as indicated by Bank for International Settlement (BIS) Triennial Central Bank Survey was 88 percent in 2022. There are clear signs that in a multipolar world, other countries have a role to play too. Dealing With Financial Flows Internationalisation of the INR at the initial stage has to focus on denominating and settling cross-border trade and financial transactions in rupees. At this stage, it is useful to note that trade presents one part of the story; to complete the story one has to take into consideration the burgeoning financial flows. Current account convertibility would allow us to handle the trade issues. However, these days many of the transactions are purely financial dealings, which are not connected to trade. As the complexity of financial flows increases, the issue of capital account convertibility would require more attention. Internationalisation of currencies of emerging countries like that of India and China has three components, firstly, there has to be invoicing in domestic currency along with trade and settlement. Secondly, there is a need to focus on capital account convertibility and thirdly, one can explore the scope of entry to special drawing rights (SDR) basket. This can allow the currency to become a part of the reserve currency of other countries' central banks. The third objective is a long-term one. Boost From Trade The increasing acceptability of a currency is also closely linked to the home country's progress in international trade. The growing demand for yuan internationally is closely linked to the growth of China's manufacturing exports. For India too, exports of goods and services can play an important role, particularly in the context of bilateral and multilateral trade arrangements in local currency. Acceptance of the INR as settlement currency by the Asian Clearing Union is indeed welcome. China's experience in this area is noteworthy, between 2009 and 2020 China opened swap lines with 41 countries. The total amount exceeded RMB 3.5 trillion which was equivalent to $554 billion. They have a similar swap line with Russia which is more than $600 billion. The primary purpose is to enhance investment and trade with bilateral partners and reduce their dependence on the dollar and increase the acceptance of the yuan. These countries include South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. In a similar manner, local currency swap arrangements would provide liquidity to our trading partners for the purchase of Indian goods and services. There is also a need to further liberalise Indian government securities, corporate and sovereign bond markets for countries like the United Arab Emirates and Russia. The sudden fillip for the rupee trade in 2022 and 2023 came from the Russian offer of discounted crude on account of sanctions. The trade deficit with Russia is now $36 billion. The question to ask is if these discounts disappear due to the withdrawal of discounted crude offers or some other reason, then what will happen to the rupee trade? In other words, the rupee trade cannot be an outlier. We need to have a clear strategy for enhancing rupee trade with a number of countries including our neighbours. Interestingly, neither India nor China has capital account convertibility, considered a precondition for the internationalisation of a currency. It is even more amazing that the yuan has become a reserve currency though not a safe haven currency without capital account convertibility. Often, we tend to forget that many countries with open capital accounts play very limited roles in international finance. Some examples are Guyana, Jamaica, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago. Relatively poorer developing economies often have an open capital account for attracting capital. Incidentally, Indonesia too has an open capital account, it is a by-product of the capital shortage days. In other words, capital account convertibility is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the success of a country's currency internationalisation process. Further, many policymakers believe that floating currency goes hand-in-hand with an open capital account, this too is not a necessary condition. Hong Kong has an open capital account but its currency is pegged to the US dollar. When US interest rates started going up, capital outflows forced Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate to move up, this in its turn had the stock market in a squeeze. All these have some lessons for India - there is no tearing hurry for capital account convertibility. The establishment of domestic macroeconomic stability conditions should precede capital account convertibility. Siddhartha Roy is the former Economic Advisor of the Tata Group.

      "Geojit's report on Agri Picks Profit booking was witnessed in NCDEX turmeric futures on Wednesday, while jeera and coriander futures gained on firm demand. Farmers have sown soybean across 12.2 mln ha so far this kharif season, up 7% from last year, according to a survey by the Soybean Processors Association of India. According to the agriculture ministry, the soybean acreage so far this season is 12.4 mln ha. In Madhya Pradesh, the largest producer of the oilseed in the country, soybean acreage is at 5.3 mln ha. Acreage in the second-largest grower, Maharashtra, is at 4.8 mln ha, data provided by SOPA showed. Since Jun 1, the country has received 528.9 mm of rainfall so far, against the normal of 526.9 mm, data from the India Meteorological Department showed. The government has pegged total oilseed output in 2022-23 (Nov-Oct) at 41.0 mln tn, against 38.0 mln tn the previous year. Soybean is a crucial kharif oilseed crop and accounts for around 30% of India's oilseed basket. The government has deferred the implementation of Cotton Bales (Quality Control) Order, 2023 to Nov 27 from Sep 1, according to a gazette notification. According to a notification issued on Feb 28, the new norm will require cotton bales to comply with the quality control order of the Bureau of Indian Standards. Earlier, the Cotton Association of India and the Tamilnadu Spinning Mills Association had written to the government to defer the implementation of a quality control order that was supposed to come into effect from Sep 1. The associations have said domestic ginners do not have adequate infrastructure to test 5% of cotton bales, as per the quality control order. Natural moisture in the lint during rainy season is about 10-12% and 15- 25% in Kapas, which is not in the hands of ginners to control moisture in the lint cotton to 8%. The associations said that even the same crop, grown at the same location and in the same environment, may not have the same quality and the same specifications. Each picking can have differential values and specifications.

      "Shares of Varroc Engineering Ltd. jumped over 12 percent in early trade on August 10 after the company reported a profit in Q1FY24 against a loss, a year ago.  At 9.30am, the stock was trading at Rs 386 on the BSE, up 12.7 percent from its previous close while India's benchmark Sensex fell 0.3 percent to 65,782 points.  The company posted a net profit of Rs 55 crore in Q1FY24 versus a loss of Rs 39 crore in Q1FY23. This positive shift is attributed to company's robust performances in both domestic and export markets, along with receipt of specific incentives from the government.  Varroc Engineering Ltd.'s revenue jumped 10.4 percent in Q1 from a year ago to Rs 1805.70 crore. EBITDA jumped 34 percent YoY to Rs 180.20 crore while EBITDA margin expanded to 10 percent from 8.2 percent year ago driven by business mix, incentives &amp;amp; operating leverage.  Catch all the market action LIVE  During Q1, the company also announced a reduction in its debt by Rs 50 crore. This reduction in debt has consequently led to a quarter-on-quarter decrease in interest costs.  \"The ongoing monsoon and festive season will be key to watch out for the automobile sector to continue its momentum. The reduction in fame II subsidy from June 1 for EV vehicles impacted EV volumes sharply but we are cautiously optimistic about the recovery in volumes in coming months\", the company said in a notice to the exchange.  \"Our focus will remain to strengthen our competitiveness in India and globally by developing world class products and services.

      "Oil prices fall as China woes offset boost from high US fuel demand\n",
      "Oil prices fell in early Asian trade on Thursday after reaching fresh highs in the previous session as concerns about the Chinese economy offset the positive impact of steep drawdowns in U.S. fuel stockpiles and Saudi and Russian output cuts.  Brent crude fell 20 cents, or 0.2%, to $87.35 a barrel by 0006 GMT, after settling at its highest since Jan. 27 in the previous session.  West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 23 cents, or 0.3%, to $84.17, after settling at its highest since November 2022.  Chinese data on Tuesday showed crude oil imports in July fell 18.8% from the previous month to their lowest daily rate since January.  China's consumer sector also fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand.  However, prices were supported by government data on Wednesday that showed that U.S. gasoline stocks fell by 2.7 million barrels last week, while distillate inventories, which include diesel and heating oil, dropped by 1.7 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for both to hold mostly steady. [EIA/S]  Also supporting prices were top exporter Saudi Arabia's plans to extend its voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels per day for another month to include September. Russia also said it would cut oil exports by 300,000 bpd in September.  Investors were also awaiting July's U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), due on Thursday, which is expected to show a slight year-over-year acceleration.\n",

      "Downgrades outpace upgrades over the past month as Q1 earnings throw up nasty surprises\n",
      "On the face of it, first quarter earnings have given the street more cause for cheer than for lament, but a closer reading shows a different picture.  According to the data from Moneycontrol's July analyst call tracker, several companies have seen significant downgrades by brokerages over the past month following the release of their first-quarter earnings.  Infosys has secured the top position with 18 buy calls, 15 holds, and 12 sells, reflecting a shift from the previous month's figures of 29 buy calls, 9 holds, and 8 sells. Following suit, Power Grid Corp Of India and Hindustan Unilever Ltd received ratings of 14 buy, 5 hold, and 3 sells, and 29 buy, 13 hold, and 3 sells, respectively. A month ago, these two companies had 18 buy, 4 holds, and zero sells, and 36 buys, 7 holds, and 2 sells, respectively. All these three stocks have fallen over 5-6 percent each in the last one month.    According to analysts, Infosys is projected to face continued stock pressure for the next two quarters. The company has revised its revenue guidance twice in a span of three months due to weakened demand. The recent wave of high-level managerial resignations has further complicated the situation. In a soft-demand environment, Infosys might be losing market share, as indicated by its subdued growth guidance for 2023-24. The series of senior-level departures in recent quarters raises concerns about the company's stability and its effectiveness in managing key verticals, contributing to the stock's ongoing underperformance, according to a recent Jefferies report.  Power Grid has recently disclosed its financial results for the quarter ending June 2023, indicating a modest 1 percent uptick in revenue. This growth was hindered by factors such as the adverse influence of tariff differentials, sluggish expansion in asset capitalisation, and a significant 46 percent YoY decline in revenue from the consultancy segment. Nonetheless, the consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) demonstrated enhancement due to improved efficiencies. On a consolidated basis, there was a slight 5 percent decline in net profit compared to the previous year, primarily attributed to a notable decrease in the profit of the consultancy segment and a nearly 20 percent reduction in other income.  HUL's earnings for the June quarter were weaker than expected. Although there has been some improvement in gross margin buildup compared to analysts' expectations, the acceleration in volume is taking longer than anticipated due to the gradual normalisation of consumer habits, JM Financial said in its recent note. The management foresees this adjustment lasting for a span of two to three quarters. Despite the company's optimism regarding rural demand recovery, increased weather-related risks have become more prominent. Notably, heightened competitive pressures have emerged, fuelled by the assertiveness of smaller players in specific categories and an elevated intensity in media competition, the JM Financial report added.  \"In FY24E, the projected outlook entails single-digit sales growth centered on volume expansion. Although the company targets substantial gross margin enhancement, this progress could be counterbalanced by the need to raise Advertising &amp;amp; Promotion (A&amp;amp;P) spending, which has declined by over 350 basis points over the last three years. While the potential for a double-digit return from the stock is recognized for the upcoming year, the valuation multiples might be constrained due to the tougher operational landscape,\" according to the JM Financial report.  UPL Ltd, Tinan Co Ltd, and Ultratech Cement Ltd saw huge downgrades as well. As per Moneycontrol's analyst call tracker, UPL received 21 buy calls, 6 holds, and 2 sell calls, compared to the previous 25 buy calls and 2 each of hold and sell calls a month ago. Titan garnered 23 buy calls, 8 holds, and 4 sells, whereas it had previously secured 27 buy calls, 5 holds, and 3 sell ratings. Similarly, Ultratech Cement received 33 buy calls, 9 holds, and 4 sells, versus the earlier 37 buy calls and 4 each of hold and sell calls.  In the June quarter, UPL Ltd encountered substantial setbacks in both its profits and revenue, mainly due to a nearly double-digit decrease in sales volume. The company responded to aggressive pricing from Chinese sellers by implementing significant price reductions in international markets, according to a Motilal Oswal report. Amid the industry's slowdown, UPL expressed its intent to prioritise profitability and cash conservation. It also anticipates a reduction in working capital days in the future. Confronting formidable global challenges during April-June, UPL has revised its revenue and operating profit guidance for the fiscal year 2023-24 (April-March). The adjustment is notable, with projected revenue growth now ranging from 1 percent to 5 percent, compared to the earlier estimate of 6 percent-10 percent. Furthermore, EBITDA is forecasted to increase by 3 percent to 7 percent, in contrast to the previously expected rise of 8 percent-12 percent.  Ultratech Cement's earnings slightly missed estimates. As per a UBS report, there are concerns among industry observers about an anticipated demand slowdown post the upcoming general elections in May 2024. This is compounded by a swift surge in new capacity that could surpass medium-term demand. The industry is expected to witness around 110 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of new capacity entering the market within the next 2.5 years, in contrast to an incremental demand of 70mtpa. UBS forecasts that cement players might adopt aggressive pricing strategies to safeguard their market share, especially with the intensifying competition due to Adani group's entry into the sector.\n",

      "Gold Rate Today: Prices at 4-week low amid strong dollar, rate hike concerns\n",
      "Gold and silver prices hit a four-week low as the US dollar held on to its strength and investors remained concerned about a potential interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. This has led to cautious sentiment among investors, prompting a shift away from precious metals.  Adding to the downward pressure on precious metals is the continuous decline in global Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) holdings. In July, ETF holdings saw a significant reduction of 34 tonnes, marking the fourth consecutive month of liquidation. The year-to-date figures for 2023 saw a total reduction of 84 tons in ETF holdings.  Market participants are now closely watching for comments from US officials, particularly related to US CPI, set to be released on August 10.

      "Hindalco keeps brokerages upbeat with June quarter earnings\n",
      "Brokerages remained bullish on Hindalco Industries Ltd and raised its target price after its better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter.  Brokerage firm JM Financial has upheld its 'buy' rating on the stock and raised its target price by 21 percent to Rs 550 per share. The firm expressed that the stock continues to be its favourite within the metals space.  Motilal Oswal Securities maintained the 'buy' rating and increased its target price to Rs 550 a share, up 21 percent from current market price. Jefferies India upped the target price by 26 percent to Rs 575, while Antique stock broking raised its target price to Rs 526 and maintained the 'buy' rating.  Hindalco reported a 9 percent on-year decrease in consolidated revenue for the first quarter of FY24, amounting to Rs 53,000 crore. This surpassed analysts' expectations by 12 percent, as their estimate stood at Rs 47,500 crore. The company also experienced a 32 percent on-year drop in consolidated EBITDA, reaching Rs 5,700 crore, but this still exceeded analysts' projections by 10 percent, compared to their estimate of Rs 5,200 crore.  The company's net profit took a hit, declining by 40 percent to Rs 2,500 crore, yet it managed to surpass analysts' estimates by 22 percent, which were at Rs 2,000 crore. This improvement was primarily driven by increased other income, although it was somewhat offset by higher interest costs and tax expenditure.  The company has reported that the Chakla mine is progressing according to its established timeline and is anticipated to commence operations by FY26. Notably, the company has also achieved success in acquiring the Meenakshi West mine, which has the potential to yield approximately 6-7 million tonnes of coal annually. Looking ahead to FY24, the projected capital expenditure (capex) for both India operations and Novelis is estimated to be Rs 4,500 crore.  Analysts hold the belief that Hindalco will sustain its positive momentum due to several factors. These factors include the confidence in Novelis achieving its medium-term EBITDA-per-tonne target of $525 by the fourth quarter of FY24, the steadfast performance of Hindalco's aluminum operations in India, strengthened coal security resulting from the acquisition of the Meenakshi and Chakla coal mines, as well as the growth-focused capital expenditure aimed at expanding capacity in the downstream business segment.  Analysts hold the perspective that Hindalco exhibits a robust outlook for long-term opportunities. Their confidence is anchored in the company's leadership position in both the beverages can and automotive markets. This optimism is fuelled by the company's strong performance, driven by factors such as sturdy domestic demand, increased demand from electric vehicles and consumer durables sectors, elevated investments in infrastructure and construction, as well as heightened public and private sector capital expenditures.  As a result, Motilal Oswal Securities has raised their estimates for FY25 EBITDA and net profit by 4 percent and 10 percent, respectively.  According to Antique Stock Broking, enhanced performance in the copper segment, improved aluminum operations (driven by increased downstream volume from the new 34 KT Silvassa extrusion facility and an ongoing additional expansion of 350 KT through debottlenecking at the Utkal Alumina), reduced coal expenses, and progress in enhancing Novelis' operations are expected to contribute to an uplift in profitability.\n",

      "Geojit's report on Agri Picks India's 2023-24 (Jul-Jun) kharif acreage was steady at 91.5 mln ha as of Friday, according to data from department of agriculture and farmers welfare. Acreage of paddy, the key grain in kharif season, was up 3% on year at 28.3 mln ha. The paddy acreage has turned positive in the last couple of weeks as sowing picked up with the increase in rainfall across the country. Monsoon rains, important for sowing rice in non-irrigated areas, were 5% above long-period average as of Friday. Since Jun 1, the country has received 504.4 mm rainfall, 5% above the normal weighted average of 481.9 mm for the period. However, serious concerns remain as the key paddy growing regions of east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam and West Bengal have received deficient precipitation so far. The weather department has projected that rainfall will be normal to above normal in some parts of northeast India during Aug-Sep. Experts believe that untimely rainfall could damage the standing crops that have been planted in the region in the ongoing season. However, rice planting in eastern states of the country has not suffered much this season despite patchy monsoon rainfall and its uneven distrubution due to efficient irrigiation facilities in the region. The area under coarse cereals was at 16.4 mln ha, up from 16.2 mln ha a year ago, ministry data showed. Acreage under oilseeds was up 3% at 18.0 mln ha and area under pulses fell 9% to 10.7 mln ha. Last week, sowing of pulses was lagging by more than 11%. Pulses sowing has taken a hit this season as farmers across the country have been sowing other crops such as soybean in hope of better returns. Soybean acreage in the country is 4% higher on-year as of Friday, according to the data. &bull; Farmers in Telangana have sown paddy over 2.5 mln acres (1 acre = 0.40 ha) in the current kharif season, up to Wednesday, a hefty rise of 73% over the previous year's figure of 1.4 mln acres, according to official data. The total sown acreage in the state as of Wednesday was 8.3 mln acres, up 12% from 7.3 mln acres a year ago, but down 5% from the normal acreage of 8.7 mln acres. As of Wednesday, cotton, the major kharif crop in the state was sown across 4.3 mln acres down from 4.5 mln acres a year ago. The area under pulses fell 17% on year to 480,240 acres from 584,215 acres. Major pulses grown in the state are red gram, green gram, and black gram. The area under coarse grains, so far, was at 470,583 acres, up from 416,468 acres last year. The foodgrain acreage rose to 3.5 mln acres from 2.5 mln acres a year ago. The state reported 432,508 acres under oilseeds, higher than 354,128 acres last year. While soybean sowing rose 23% on year to 426,208 acres, groundnut fell 16% on year to 5,171 acres.

      "Oil edges up on higher US economic growth outlook; China import slump weighs\n",
      "Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as a U.S. government agency projected a rosier outlook on the economy, but bearish data on China's crude imports and exports weighed.  Brent crude futures gained 83 cents to settle at $86.17 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 98 cents to $82.92.  Both contracts had fallen by $2 earlier in the session, but prices reversed course after a monthly report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected gross domestic product growth to rise by 1.9% in 2023, up from 1.5% in a previous forecast. [EIA/M]  The EIA also expects Brent crude oil prices to average $86 in the second half of 2023, up about $7 from the previous forecast.  U.S. crude production is expected to rise by 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 12.76 million bpd in 2023, the report added, overtaking the last peak of 12.3 million bpd in 2019.  Crude prices have been rising since June, primarily because of extended voluntary cuts to Saudi Arabia's production as well as increasing global demand, the EIA said.  \"We expect these factors will continue to reduce global oil inventories and put upward pressure on oil prices in the coming months,\" the EIA added.  Weighing on prices on Tuesday, however, China's July oil imports were down 18.8% from the previous month to the lowest daily rate since January, but still up 17% from a year earlier.  Overall, China's imports contracted by 12.4% in July, far steeper than the expected 5% drop. Exports fell by 14.5%, compared with a fall of 12.5% tipped by economists.  Despite the gloomy data, some analysts were still positive on China's fuel demand outlook for August to early October.  The peak season for construction and manufacturing activity starts in September and gasoline consumption should benefit from summer travel demand, said CMC Markets analyst Leon Li. Demand is expected to decrease gradually after October, he added.  Last week's decision by Saudi Arabia to extend a voluntary output cut of 1 million bpd into September, despite Brent rising above $80, suggested Riyadh might be targeting a higher price than $80, said Vivek Dhar, mining and energy commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  Still, some analysts were sceptical about how much supply the cuts were actually taking off the market, as other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries such as Libya and Venezuela have increased production, said Andrew Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.  \"The production cuts have been far less than the announced quota cuts,\" Lipow said.  U.S. crude oil stocks rose last week, while gasoline and distillate stockpiles dropped, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. [API/S]  Crude stocks rose by about 4.1 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 4, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Gasoline inventories fell by about 400,000 barrels, while distillate inventories fell by about 2.1 million barrels.  U.S. government data on stockpiles is due on Wednesday.\n",

      "Gold Rate Today: Prices at 1-month low as US bond yields edge higher\n",
      "Gold prices witnessed a notable decline and hit a one-month low on the back of strength in US dollar and rising treasury yields, which exerted pressure on the precious metals market.  In such economic conditions, investors flock to alternative assets such as gold and silver, as a hedge against currency fluctuations.  The downward trend was further underscored by silver prices plummeting by 2 percent overnight and a staggering 5.5 percent over the week.  Moreover, US Federal Reserve official Bowman hinted at the likelihood of additional rate hikes in an effort to curb inflation, which added to the market sentiment and influenced the recent price movements in safe haven assets.  Investors now eagerly await inflation data from the US to be released on August 10, which is expected to provide more insights into the economic landscape.  Moreover, rising uncertainties globally, weak economic data and geopolitical tensions have further contributed to the downward pressure on precious metal prices.

      "Oil falls as US rate hike fears subside, China demand weighs\n",
      "Oil prices fell slightly on Thursday, with Brent crude holding close to January highs, as speculation about another U.S. interest rate hike faded following inflation data and OPEC remained positive on the oil demand outlook.  Both benchmarks have been on a sustained rally since June, with WTI trading at its highest this year on Thursday and Brent hitting its highest price since January.  Brent crude fell 72 cents to $83.68 a barrel at 11:55 a.m. EDT (1555 GMT). West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) was down 46 cents at $87.09, after falling by $1 earlier in the session.  Oil prices have been boosted in recent days by extensions to output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, alongside supply fears driven by the potential for conflict between Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea region to threaten Russian oil shipments.  But recent data showed the consumer sector in China fell into deflation and factory gate prices extended declines in July, raising concerns about fuel demand in the world's second-largest economy.  The U.S. is also prohibiting some investment in China in sensitive technologies like computer chips and requires government notification in other tech sectors.  \"China's data just gets worse and worse, and this is only going to make it more difficult for China to ramp up its economy,\" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.  Lending support to prices, OPEC said in its monthly report on Thursday it expected a healthy oil market for the rest of the year, and stuck by its forecast for robust oil demand in 2024, as the outlook for world economic growth slightly improves.  Thursday's U.S. consumer prices data for July fuelled speculation the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its aggressive rate hike cycle.  Markets largely shrugged off a higher-than-expected 5.85 million-barrel build in U.S. crude stocks reported on Wednesday, after a record drawdown the week before.\n",

      "Average long-term US mortgage rate climbs to 6.96% this week, matching highest level this year\n",
      "The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate rose this week to just under 7%, the latest setback for would-be homebuyers already facing affordability challenges due to a housing market limited by a shortage of homes for sale.  Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on the benchmark 30-year home loan rose to 6.96% from 6.90% last week. A year ago, the rate averaged 5.22%.  It's the third consecutive weekly increase for the average rate, which now matches its high for the year set on July 13. High rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, limiting how much they can afford in a market already unaffordable to many Americans.  \"There is no doubt continued high rates will prolong affordability challenges longer than expected, particularly with home prices on the rise again,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. \"However, upward pressure on rates is the product of a resilient economy with low unemployment and strong wage growth, which historically has kept purchase demand solid.\"  The average rate on a 30-year mortgage remains more than double what it was two years ago, when it was just 2.87%. Those ultra-low rates spurred a wave of home sales and refinancing. The sharply higher rates now are contributing to a dearth of available homes, as homeowners who locked in those lower borrowing costs two years ago are now reluctant to sell and jump into a higher rate on a new property.  The lack of housing supply is also a big reason home sales are down 23% through the first half of this year.  The latest increase in rates follows an uptick in the 10-year Treasury yield, which climbed to 4.19% last week, it's highest level since early November. The yield, which lenders use to price rates on mortgages and other loans, was at 4.02% in midday trading Thursday.  High inflation drove the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022, lifting the fed funds rate to the highest level in 22 years. Inflation has come down steadily since last summer, and many analysts believe the Fed has reached the end of its rate hikes.  Mortgage rates don't necessarily mirror the Fed's rate increases, but tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Investors' expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Fed does with interest rates can influence rates on home loans.  The average rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with those refinancing their homes, rose to 6.34% from 6.25% last week. A year ago, it averaged 4.59%, Freddie Mac said.\n",

      "California agency to vote on San Francisco robotaxi expansion amid heavy opposition\n",
      "Amid strenuous pushback from San Francisco officials and many residents, a California state agency is set to vote on Thursday on a proposal to allow the city to be blanketed in self-driving taxis at all hours.  Approval would grant General Motors' Cruise and Alphabet Inc's Waymo the right to expand testing of their autonomous vehicles as paid taxis across the city, putting them in direct competition with ride-hailing providers Uber and Lyft.  The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which has statewide jurisdiction over autonomous vehicle regulation, drafted the proposal after Waymo and Cruise applied for permits that would allow for broader testing of the robotaxis.  The companies, which have ploughed billions into developing the vehicles, with little revenue, see the vote as a critical next step to broader regulation as they eye expanding into new cities and states.  But the vote at the meeting that begins at 11 a.m. PDT (1800 GMT) comes amid vigorous opposition from transportation and safety agencies in San Francisco.  They say the robot cars' sometimes unpredictable driving has interfered with fire officials, caused traffic jams and violated other rules of the road and that the companies fail to fully disclose data showing hiccups. They have sought a slower rollout.  Cruise and Waymo, in contrast, have asserted their robotaxis are safer than distractable human drivers, have not caused any deaths or life-threatening injuries over millions of collective miles driven and that real-world testing is critical to perfecting the technology.  Cruise said at a recent public hearing that it has about 300 vehicles in operation at night and 100 during the day, while Waymo said it has roughly 250. Both are expected to add to that number if the CPUC approves the proposal.  The measure has divided San Francisco between locals who resent their city being used as a testing lab for what they say is an unproven technology and those who say they feel the symbolic technology capital ought to be the leader in developing what could lead to fewer traffic accidents and injuries.  The CPUC has twice delayed the vote, in part because of the mounting opposition.  The CPUC on Tuesday heard testimony from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency that it had logged close to 600 incidents involving autonomous vehicles since the spring of 2022 and that they believe that is \"a fraction\" of the total due to what they say are lax reporting requirements.  Outfitted with spinning sensors, Waymo and Cruise vehicles are an arresting sight around San Francisco, particularly to visitors unaccustomed to cars with no human driver behind the wheel. Summoned by app, like ride-hailing trips, the vehicles are allowed to take passengers for free around much of the city, with some restrictions, and can only charge at night.\n",

      "US inflation rises for the first time in a year to 3.2% rate, but underlying measures remain mild\n",
      "Inflation in the United States rose in July after 12 straight months of declines, boosted by costlier housing. But excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation matched the smallest monthly increase in nearly two years. The inflation figure the government reported Thursday showed that consumer prices increased 3.2% from a year earlier. That was up from a 3% annual rise in June, which was the lowest rate in more than two years.  The July inflation figure remained far below last year's peak of 9.1%, though still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The Fed, economists and investors, though, pay particular attention to the core inflation figures for signs of where inflationary pressures might be headed. From June to July, core inflation remained a tame 0.2%. Thursday's price data will be among the key barometers the Fed will weigh in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates.  In its drive to tame inflation, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate 11 times since March 2022 to a 22-year high. A jump in energy prices has rekindled some of the inflation pressures underlying the economy. Gasoline prices have surged nearly 30 cents over the past month to a national average of $3.83 a gallon, according to AAA. Economists say that in the fight to conquer inflation, easy progress has likely already been achieved. Gasoline prices, for example, though liable to bounce around from month to month, have already plunged from a peak national average of more than $5 a gallon, which was reached in June of last year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Much of the inflationary surge that began in 2021 was caused by clogged supply chains: Ports, factories and freight yards were overwhelmed by the explosive economic rebound from the pandemic recession of 2020. The result was delays, parts shortages and higher prices. But supply-chain backlogs have eased in the past year, sharply reducing upward pressure on goods prices.  Prices of long-lasting manufactured goods actually dipped in June. Now, the Fed faces a daunting problem: persistent inflationary pressures in service businesses - restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues and the like - where wages represent a substantial share of costs. Worker shortages have led many of these services companies to sharply raise pay. Last week, for example, the Labor Department reported that average hourly wages rose 4.4% in July from a year earlier, more than expected.  To cover their higher labor costs, companies have typically raised their prices, thereby fueling inflation. Another factor working against continued declines in year-over-year inflation rates is that prices soared in the first half of last year before slowing in the second half. So any price increase in July would have the effect of boosting the year-over-year inflation rate. Still, economists caution against reading too much into one month of numbers.  Many of them expect inflation to continue trending lower. Used car prices, which had skyrocketed after the pandemic, have been edging down: They dropped 5.1% in July from a year earlier to $29,198, according to Edmunds.com. July of last year was near the peak of used-car price spikes, resulting from a scarcity of new vehicles caused by a global computer-chip shortage. Buyers who wanted new vehicles but couldn't find them entered the used market, sending used prices sharply higher.  This year, though, used vehicle prices began to drop once automakers managed to acquire more chips and could produce more new vehicles. Many shoppers who were forced to buy used are now back in the new-vehicle market. Used-vehicle prices are expected to decline, at least modestly, through the year. Despite chronic concerns about higher labor costs, one closely watched measure of wages and salaries - the Labor Department's employment cost index - grew more slowly from April through June.  Excluding government jobs, employee pay rose 1%, less than the 1.2% increase in the first three months of 2023. Compared with a year earlier, wages and salaries grew 4.6%, down from a year-over-year increase of 5.1% in the first quarter. Rents, which had soared after the pandemic, are also cooling. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote this week that \"year-over-year shelter inflation will continue to slow through late 2024 and may even turn negative by mid-2024.\"  Fed officials will have plenty of data to absorb before deciding whether to continue raising rates. Thursday's report is the first of two CPI numbers the policymakers will see before their next meeting on Sept. 19-20. In addition, their favoured inflation gauge, called the personal income expenditures price index, comes out on Aug. 31. And the August jobs report will be released on Sept. 1. Many economists and market analysts think the Fed's most recent rate hike in July will prove to be its last: Nearly 87% of traders expect no Fed hike next month, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n",

      "Number of Americans applying for jobless aid rises, but not enough to cause concern\n",
      "The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits jumped last week, but not enough to raise a concern about the consistently strong U.S. labor market.  U.S. applications for unemployment benefits rose by 21,000 to 248,000 for the week ending August 5, from 227,000 the week before, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That's the most in five weeks.  The four-week moving average of claims, a less volatile reading, ticked up by 2,750 to 228,250.  Jobless claim applications are viewed as broadly representative of the number of layoffs in a given week.  Applications for jobless aid reached a higher level above 260,000 for a few weeks this spring, causing some concern, but then retreated.  Troubling levels of inflation moved the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a breakneck pace for the past year-and-a-half: the central bank raised its benchmark rate 11 times to the current 5.4%, a 22-year high.  Part of the Fed's reasoning was to cool the job market and bring down wages, which, in theory, suppresses price growth. Though inflation has come down significantly during that stretch, the job market has remained remarkably strong.  Last week, the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added 187,000 jobs in July, fewer than expected, but still a healthy number. The unemployment rate dipped to 3.5%, close to a half-century low.  Also last week, the government reported that job openings fell below 9.6 million in June, the lowest in more than two years. However, the numbers remain unusually robust considering monthly job openings never topped 8 million before 2021.  Outside of a flurry of layoffs in the technology sector early this year, companies have mostly been retaining workers.  Many businesses struggled to replenish their workforces after cutting jobs during the pandemic, and much of the ongoing hiring likely reflects efforts by many firms to catch up to elevated levels of consumer demand that have emerged since the pandemic recession.  While the manufacturing, warehousing, and retail industries have slowed their hiring in recent months, they aren't yet cutting jobs in large numbers. Economists say that given the difficulties in finding workers during the past two years, businesses will likely hold onto them as long as possible, even if the economy weakens.  Overall, 1.68 million people were collecting unemployment benefits the week that ended July 29, about 8,000 fewer than the previous week.\n",

      "Investors Brace for Fallout From Ecuador Candidate's Killing\n",
      "Fernando Villavicencio, an anti-graft crusader and journalist, was murdered while leaving a political rally at school in the capital city of Quito late on Wednesday. Warring cocaine cartels have turned the once-peaceful country into one of the most violent places in the world, making law and order central to all candidates running in the upcoming elections.  As the nation reels, investors are looking for potential unrest, and trying to assess how the shocking events will impact voters ahead of the Aug. 20 election. Villavicencio was the second-most favoured candidate behind socialist Luisa Gonzalez, according to a poll released Wednesday. Conservative former sniper Jan Topic placed third, followed by Indigenous leader Yaku Perez and former vice president Otto Sonnenholzner.  \"This will favour the extremes,\" said Ramiro Blazquez, head of research and strategy at BancTrust.  The country's assets are already trading at distressed levels, after dollar bonds lost more than 25% this year, one of the worst performances in emerging markets globally. Losses accelerated after voters rejected referendum proposals and political opponents mounted an impeachment campaign against President Guillermo Lasso, prompting him to close Congress and triggering a snap vote.  Distressed Debt The selloff has left bonds due in 2035 and 2040, some of the nation's most liquid, trading at 30 to 35 cents on the dollar, levels they've been fairly steady at since March. The 2035 notes were quoted at 34.34 cents and the 2040s at 31.21 cents as of 9 a.m. in London on Thursday, according to indicative pricing on Bloomberg. Earlier on Wednesday, JPMorgan had recommended an overweight position on the nation's debt.  \"There has been relative social balance in Ecuador since Lasso used constitutional powers to dissolve the government and call for elections,\" said Oren Barack, managing director of fixed income at New York-based Alliance Global Partners. \"With very few details over the assassination, social unrest and protests are likely to occur over the coming days.\"  Ecuador has a checkered financial history. Since its independence, it has defaulted on its external debt 11 times, most recently at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. While the investment scenario improved under Lasso, with international reserves near record highs, minimal debt service payments and a narrowing fiscal deficit, the return of a hard left administration could upend the outlook for markets.  That possibility has likely diminished with Villavicencio's murder, according to Katrina Butt, senior economist for emerging markets at AllianceBernstein in New York.  \"It might provide more support in consolidation of the center-right candidate,\" she said, referring to Sonnenholzner. It could also benefit Topic's security-focused campaign but would be unlikely to provide a boost to the most leftist candidate, Perez, whose platform had little overlap with Villavicencio's.  Ecuador's election is one of a trio of Latin American votes this month in which crime and security are major issues. Argentina holds primaries on August 13 and Guatemala holds a runoff presidential vote on Aug. 20.\n",

      "WHO classifies 'Eris' Covid strain as 'variant of interest\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the EG.5 strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in different parts of the world, including India, as a \"variant of interest\" but said it did not seem to pose more of a threat to public health than other strains.  EG.5 or Eris variant of SARS-CoV-2 was first reported on February 17 this year, and designated as a variant under monitoring (VUM) on July 19. In its latest risk evaluation on Wednesday, the WHO designated EG.5 and its sub-lineages as a variant of interest (VOI). Variants are broadly categorised into three categories: (1) variants of interest (2) variants of concern and (3) variants of high consequence.  According to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), VOIs are defined as variants with specific genetic markers that have been associated with changes that may cause enhanced transmissibility or virulence, reduction in neutralisation by antibodies obtained through natural infection or vaccination. EG.5 is a descendent lineage of Omicron subvariant XBB.1.9.2. It carries an additional mutation in the spike protein, which the SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter and infect the human cells compared to the parent subvariant.  Within the EG.5 lineage, the subvariant EG.5.1 has an additional spike mutation and represents 88 per cent of the available sequences for EG.5 and its descendent lineages, the WHO said. As of August 7, 7,354 sequences of EG.5 have been submitted to GISAID, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, from 51 countries. The largest portion of EG.5 sequences are from China (30.6 per cent, 2,247 sequences).  The other countries with at least 100 sequences are the US, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia, Singapore, the UK, France, Portugal, and Spain. In India, only one case of EG.5 has been reported so far from Pune in May this year. Globally, there has been a steady increase in the proportion of EG.5 reported. During epidemiological week 29 (July 17 to 23, 2023), the global prevalence of EG.5 was 17.4 per cent, according to WHO.  Based on the available evidence, the public health risk posed by EG.5 is evaluated as low at the global level, aligning with the risk associated with XBB.1.16 and the other currently circulating VOIs. WHO in its risk evaluation report noted that while EG.5 has shown increased prevalence, growth advantage, and immune escape properties, there have been no reported changes in disease severity to date.  While concurrent increases in the proportion of EG.5 and COVID-19 hospitalisations (lower than previous waves) have been observed in countries such as Japan and Korea, no associations have been made between these hospitalisations and EG.5. However, due to its growth advantage and immune escape characteristics, EG.5 may cause a rise in case incidence and become dominant in some countries or even globally, according to the global health body.  WHO and its Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Evolution (TAG-VE) continue to recommend that countries prioritise specific actions to better address uncertainties relating to antibody escape and severity of EG.5. The global health authority has advised countries to share information on the growth advantage of EG.5 and provide sequence information.  It also urged the member countries to conduct neutralisation assays using human blood samples, representative of the affected communities, and EG.5 live virus isolates. The WHO and its Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) continue to regularly assess the impact of variants on the performance of COVID-19 vaccines to inform decisions on updates to vaccine composition.\n",

      "Heat, War and Trade Protections Raise Uncertainty for Food Prices\n",
      "As the rate of food price inflation eases in the United States and Europe, analysts are warning of a new era of volatility in global food prices, ushered in by a series of threats coming together in unprecedented ways.  A combination of calamities - extreme weather, Russia's targeting of grain supplies in Ukraine and some countries' growing willingness to erect protectionist barriers to food trade - has left food supplies more vulnerable and less prepared to absorb any one disruption, analysts say.  \"This is the new normal now, with more volatility and unpredictability, whether that's in commodity prices or food prices,\" said Dennis Voznesenski, a commodities analyst at Rabobank in Sydney, Australia.  Even without major disruptions, food prices can be variable, and many factors play into the price of a bushel of wheat or loaf of bread.  Last month, Russia pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal that had permitted Ukrainian farm exports by sea. The United Nations' food price index rose in July, interrupting its monthslong downward trend because of a jump in vegetable oil prices, driven in part by worries over shortages of Ukrainian sunflower seeds.  Droughts in India, Indonesia and other Asian food exporters have led to smaller harvests. Faced with consumers outraged over higher prices, governments have banned the export of critical foods, causing further disruptions. Since late June, the price of an Asian benchmark for rice has jumped 25%, according to the Thai Rice Exporters Association.  Other factors are pressuring prices on supermarket shelves, including higher labor costs as workers try to keep pace with inflation. And food producers are finding that in an environment of rising prices, they can lift them even higher to pad their profits.  Compared with early 2020, consumer food prices are up about 30% in Europe and 23% in the United States.  The disruptions have had a disproportionately negative impact on small farmers and people living in low-income countries, while leaving the world vulnerable to future upheaval. Last year, more than 700 million people faced hunger and 2.4 billion people lacked year-round access to sufficient and nutritious food, according to the United Nations.  \"The accumulation of the last shocks in the last few years have put countries in a very, very bad situation,\" said Maximo Torero, the chief economist of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. \"If another shock comes today, I honestly don't know how they're going to handle it.\"  Extreme Weather  This year, severe weather has been the main disrupter of food prices, said Hiral Patel, the head of sustainable and thematic research at Barclays in London.  Heat waves have broken records in China, wildfires have raged across southern Europe and North Africa, and July was the world's hottest month on record.  In Pakistan, where catastrophic floods in 2022 washed away much of the country's crops, the annual rate of food price inflation reached nearly 49% in May, according to the U.N. World Food Program.  Forecasters warn that the earth could be entering a multiyear period of exceptional warmth driven by greenhouses gas emissions and the return of El Ni&ntilde;o, a cyclical weather pattern.  \"There are increased chances of simultaneous crop losses in different parts of the world,\" Patel said.  The forecast for Europe's crop yields, including soft wheat and spring barley, was revised lower recently by the European Commission because of \"distinctly drier-than-usual conditions\" in large parts of the continent.  Curtailed food production in one region for one year usually does not matter much in a flexible and dynamic market, said Joseph Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. The issue arises when crops are knocked out for a few years running in multiple markets - for example, from droughts.  \"Those could create a lot more volatility going forward - it's one of the uncertainties about climate change,\" Glauber said. Persistent droughts \"could lead to regional shortfalls and, with poor countries unable to afford higher prices, food security issues.\"  War in Ukraine  Last month, when Russian President Vladimir Putin let the Black Sea grain deal expire and then his military attacked grain storage in Ukraine, the price of wheat rose, which in turn lifted prices of corn and soybeans. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, recently estimated that the end of the deal could lead grain prices to increase by 10-15 percent.  While that's a significant jump, it's smaller than the sudden surge in prices in the first weeks of the war.  That's because Ukrainian farmers are growing significantly less today. Ukraine also has increased its ability to export grain via rail and river, but these alternative routes cost more, said Voznesenski at Rabobank. And these routes aren't immune from attacks or severe weather, including drought.  \"You can't tell what Putin is going to do tomorrow,\" Voznesenski said. \"You can't tell when a government is going to put an export restriction in.\" An increase in food supply intervention by governments \"is going to create a lot more unpredictability,\" he added.  Trade Protectionism  Volatility in food prices has encouraged some governments to turn to restricting trade in order to keep precious stores of food closer to home.  Last month, India, the world's largest rice supplier, issued an export ban on non-basmati white rice. India had imposed a 20% export duty on that rice last year, but exports continued to rise because of geopolitical issues and extreme climate conditions in other countries, the Indian government said. On Friday, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported that rice prices in July were up nearly 20% from a year earlier, pushing its rice price index to the highest in 12 years.  India is not alone in taking such measures. Overall, the number of curbs or tax increases on food exports has jumped 62% since last year, according to the Global Trade Alert, a nonprofit based in Switzerland. Globally, 176 export curbs are in effect on food, feed or fertilizer.  Economists and trade experts have cautioned against these types of policies. Though they may shield local consumers from food inflation in the near term, they ultimately compound the types of global food shortages that governments are trying to mitigate.  In a recent food security summit hosted by the U.N. in Rome, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director general of the World Trade Organization, urged countries to reject protectionism and turn to more open trade as a way to address food shortages.  For many countries, the problem has been worsened by the weak value of their currencies in comparison with the U.S. dollar, which leaves them unable to buy as many dollar-denominated commodities as before.  Invisible Costs  As food producers are dealing with more supply risks, related expenses are also rising. Much of the cost of food we eat at home comes from transportation and other expenses faced by food companies - not just from the commodity cost of growing the wheat or sugar. And some of those nonagricultural costs are rising, too.  Companies are being forced to fork out money for insurance policies to deal with harsh weather and invest in new suppliers to make their business more resilient.  Persistent drought has lowered water levels on key shipping routes, including the Panama Canal and the Rhine River in Europe, requiring shippers to lighten their loads or find other routes.  And then there is the cost of sustainability efforts as countries seek to meet net-zero-emissions targets. In all, risks that food prices stay high or swing more wildly have grown.
