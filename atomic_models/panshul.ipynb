A year ago, the rate averaged 5.22%.\\n\\nIt&rsquo;s the third consecutive weekly increase for the average rate, which now matches its high for the year set on July 13. High rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, limiting how much they can afford in a market already unaffordable to many Americans.\\n\\n&ldquo;There is no doubt continued high rates will prolong affordability challenges longer than expected, particularly with home prices on the rise again,&amp;quot; said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac&rsquo;s chief economist. &amp;quot;However, upward pressure on rates is the product of a resilient economy with low unemployment and strong wage growth, which historically has kept purchase demand solid.&rdquo;\\n\\nThe average rate on a 30-year mortgage remains more than double what it was two years ago, when it was just 2.87%. Those ultra-low rates spurred a wave of home sales and refinancing. The sharply higher rates now are contributing to a dearth of available homes, as homeowners who locked in those lower borrowing costs two years ago are now reluctant to sell and jump into a higher rate on a new property.\\n\\nThe lack of housing supply is also a big reason&nbsp;home sales are down 23% through the first half of this year.\\n\\nThe latest increase in rates follows an uptick in the 10-year Treasury yield, which climbed to 4.19% last week, it's highest level since early November. The yield, which lenders use to price rates on mortgages and other loans, was at 4.02% in midday trading Thursday.\\n\\nHigh inflation drove the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022, lifting the fed funds rate to the highest level in 22 years. Inflation has come down steadily since last summer, and many analysts believe the Fed has reached the end of its rate hikes.\\n\\nMortgage rates don&rsquo;t necessarily mirror the Fed&rsquo;s rate increases, but tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Investors&rsquo; expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Fed does with interest rates can influence rates on home loans.\\n\\nThe average rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with those refinancing their homes, rose to 6.34% from 6.25% last week. A year ago, it averaged 4.59%, Freddie Mac said.\"], ['moneycontrol', 'Domestic passenger vehicle wholesales rise 2.94% in July: SIAM', 'Domestic passenger vehicles wholesales registered a 2.94 per cent year-on-year increase in July at 3,02,521 units, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers said on Thursday.\\n\\nAs per the latest data issued by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), dispatches of passenger vehicles (PVs) from manufacturers to dealers were at 2,93,865 units in July 2022.\\n\\nTwo-wheeler domestic wholesales were down at 12,82,054 units last month, as against 13,81,303 units in July 2022.\\n\\nThree-wheeler wholesales were higher at 56,034 units, as compared to 31,324 units in the year-ago month.\\n\\nTotal vehicle dispatches across categories were at 16,40,727 units, as compared to 17,06,545 units in July 2022, SIAM said.\\n\\n&amp;quot;Though the passenger vehicle and three-wheeler segments are performing well, there has been a de-growth of two-wheelers in July 2023, compared to July 2022.\\n\\n&amp;quot;Overall, we expect that the positive economic environment, good monsoons, and upcoming festive season will support continued growth in the auto industry,&amp;quot; SIAM President Vinod Aggarwal SIAM said.'], ['moneycontrol', \"What's behind the contrasting investment trends in multi-cap and flexi-cap funds?\", \"Multi-cap and flexi-cap funds, which invest across large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks, have been witnessing contrasting trends in investments over the past three months.\\n\\nAs per Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) data for July, multi-cap funds witnessed net inflows worth Rs 2,500 crore while flexi-cap funds saw outflows to the tune of Rs 932 crore.\\n\\nFurther, over the last three months, multi-cap funds have seen investments of Rs 3,340 crore while flexi-cap funds saw net selling of Rs 1,317 crore.\\n\\nBoth multi-cap and flexi-cap funds work under the same mandate of investing across market capitalisations, albeit to different degrees.

However, the regulatory mandate on their exposure to different market-caps makes them very different and changes their risk profiles.\\n\\n&ldquo;There is no comparison between a flexi-cap and a multi-cap fund. Flexi-cap funds are pseudo large-cap funds, with one or two exceptions. On the other hand, multi-cap funds are a pure market-cap diversification category,&rdquo; said Kirtan Shah, founder of Credence Wealth Advisors.\\n\\nIn the flexi-cap category, fund managers have the flexibility to change market-capitalisation exposure based on their view of where the market is heading, an option that is not available to multi-cap funds.\\n\\n&ldquo;This increases the risk element. In the last few years, mid-caps and small caps have generated better returns, but these are the places where the volatility could also be higher, plus large-caps are more or less stable.

On August 7, TVS Supply Chain Solutions announced that its IPO will be open for bidding from August 10 to August 14. The last TVS Group company to be listed was TVS Electronics in 1994.\\n\\nTVS Supply Chain Solutions began operations as a part of the group under the name TVS Logistics before becoming a separate company in 2004.\\n\\nToday, TVS Supply Chain Solutions, or TVS SCS, as a global supply chain company, provides end-to-end solutions to Fortune 500 companies across the world. The business is divided into two main components: Integrated Supply Chain Solutions and Network Solutions.\\n\\nALSO READ: TVS Supply Chain Solutions IPO records 36% booking on debut\\n\\nUnder Integrated Supply Chain Solutions, the company provides technology-based solutions for sourcing and procurement, integrated transportation, product management solutions, logistics operation centres and in-plant logistics such as finished goods and after-market fulfilment among others.\\n\\nUnder Network Solutions, it provides two types of services: Global Freight Solutions and Time Critical Final Mile Solutions, which include a variety of services such as spare parts logistics services, return, refurbishment and engineering support and courier services to B2B businesses, both large and small.\\n\\nTranslated, what this means is that, a manufacturing company, after having recognised its suppliers and customers, need not bother about how to get things &ldquo;moving.&rdquo; It can outsource the entire operations to TVS Supply Chain, which will pick up the raw material from anywhere in the world and get it to delivered to the company&rsquo;s factories, and pick up finished good and deliver to its customers, be it in India or abroad. All the works along the way, be it warehousing or booking containers for transport, or taking care of custom clearances, the company will take care of everything.\\n\\nNow, we know India is likely to grow exports big-time, thanks to government&rsquo;s thrust and global companies&rsquo; push to diversify their sourcing base beyond China, widely termed as a China-plus-one strategy. This obviously means more business for a company like TVS Supply Chain.\\n\\nOn solid ground\\n\\nAnalysts believe the company has the competitive strength to provide end-to-end supply-chain solutions. So far, the company has grown largely through acquisitions, about 16 acquisitions over the past 17&nbsp; years.&nbsp; Thus, it has both the domain expertise, and the global presence, which means it can replicate the know-how to future customers operating in a variety of geographies and industries.\\n\\nCurrently, TVS SCS has clientele in 26 countries across Europe, Asia (including India) and Australia.\\n\\nAccording to a report by HDFC Securities, with the use of integrated, data-driven, end-to-end solutions, the company has been able deliver value to customer and gain their trust. This has mean high rate of repeat customers, which ensures a steady flow of business from existing customers, even as the company focusses on new customer additions.\\n\\n&ldquo;Our unit of measure is a project or a contract; how many contracts do we have, what is the longevity of these contracts, and what is our renewal ability&hellip;We have a renewal rate of around 99 percent, and it is our ability to win new contracts, which is the focus,&rdquo; Ravi Viswanathan, Managing Director, TVS SCS, told Moneycontrol during a recent interaction. Recently, it added UK-based Centrica plc to its roster for &ldquo;supply chain transformation&rdquo;. Like most of its deals, TVS signed the Centrica deal for 7 years plus.\\n\\nDiversified portfolio\\n\\nWhile the business opportunity for TVS is huge, and it has a replicable model in place, by the very nature of its business, it won&rsquo;t be immune to any headwinds in global trade, say analysts. This is what the Covid period showed. During Covid, the company&rsquo;s revenue hardly grew and the business made losses. Only in FY23, it could get back in the green with a profit of Rs 10,311.01 crore.\\n\\nWhat saves the day for the company in bad times though is the fact that it has a diversified portfolio. Any slump in one particular industry or country may be off-set by growth in the others. &ldquo;The global supply chains were impacted and so were many of our customers like electronic components and auto manufacturers. Thankfully, our portfolio is fairly diverse. So we were able to manage the business effectively,&rdquo; it said. Currently, about 50 percent of TVS SCS business comes from manufacturing; 30 percent comes from non-auto and 20 percent comes from auto. Non-auto businesses include electronics, mining, alternate power, technology and consumer goods while within auto it supports both production and the after-markets. &ldquo;In many ways, our business model is a de-risked one. In spite of very strong economic headwinds in the western markets because of the war and inflation, last fiscal our business grew,&rdquo; the management recently told Moneycontrol.\\n\\nCapital intensity\\n\\nThe past three fiscal years for which its financials are available, the company clocked losses in two years. Last fiscal, it recorded a net profit of Rs 41.7 crore as against a loss of Rs 73.9 crore in FY21. EBIDTA margin for FY23 stood at 6.68 percent. Return ratios were also unimpressive with ROE at 5.50&nbsp;percent and ROCE at 7.64 percent.\\n\\n .\\n\\nThe financial numbers at this point do not point to a very profitable business, although the management boasts of an &lsquo;asset-light&rsquo; model and says that it is striving for a double digit EBIDTA by in the next few years. Being asset-light means that the company does not own any its fleet, containers or warehouse space, all of which is great because it means the capital requirement for the business is not too much. It leases warehouses and vehicles and has complete control over control over the capacity and fleet. The scheduling, routing, storing, and delivery of goods are managed by the company, which enables it to maintain control over operational quality metrics while keep things flexible to suit customer requirements.\\n\\nYet, the asset-light model is largely seen as a good model, a HDFC Securities report says that the company&rsquo;s high dependency on third parties and network partners for warehousing and transformation, could impact operations, financials and cash flows. Besides, the company&rsquo;s freight, clearing, forwarding and handling charges, and manpower expenses (comprising employee benefit expenses, sub-contracting costs and casual labour charges) constitute a significant portion of its operating expenses, which means any increase due to any internal or external factors may also adversely affect kits financials. While these are usually passed on to the clients, it may not always be possible, and depends on what the contracts provide for. Another challenge HDFC Securities points out is its exposure to foreign currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency could impact both its revenue and borrowings.\\n\\nIndia opportunities\\n\\nWhile a lot of its presence is international, the growing supply chain market in India and the absence of a large-scale player of its size could be of advantage for TVS SCS in the domestic market, and most analysts believe that&rsquo;s what makes the company stand out is its diverse set of services with no like-to-like peer in the market. Currently, a large portion of the third-party logistics market in India is highly disorganised.\\n\\n\\n\\nNirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom, said, &ldquo;TVS SCS has the edge of large institutional clients, scale and expanse and the ability to provide end-to-end solutions which no other company does. This definitely has its advantages, including ease in creating synergies across different points in the supply chain process.&rdquo;\\n\\nIndeed, the logistics industry in India is expected to grow to $385 billion by FY2027 at a CAGR of 13 percent from FY2022 driven by favourable macroeconomic factors, growth of outsourcing in the Indian logistics sector, and government policies encouraging manufacturing and consumption such as the PLI scheme. Over the last couple of years, on the back of the China Plus One strategy by global companies, the government has been encouraging domestic manufacturing. Analysts believe this could be an additional advantage for the segment.\\n\\nIPO in focus\\n\\nTVS SCS had initially announced its intention for an IPO last year but it was reported that this was postponed keeping market conditions and investor sentiments in mind. Through the IPO, the company, which is being valued at Rs 9,200 crore, plans to raise around Rs 600 crore from fresh issue as against Rs 2,000 crore decided earlier. The funds raised, according to the company, will play an important role in helping it overcome past challenges associated with debt. Similarly, it has cut its offer-for-sale to 14.23 million shares from 59 million shares planned earlier. The fixed price band for its initial public offering is Rs 187-197. At the higher end of the issue price, the company is valued at a market-cap of Rs 8,750 crore. The issue is priced at 10.5 times based on its net asset value of Rs 18.89 as of Mar 2023.\\n\\nConsidering the company&rsquo;s pedigree with the TVS group, which is seen as a shareholder-friendly group, and the tremendous growth opportunity, the stock seems to have the potential to ride the growth wave and create wealth over the long haul. But in the short to medium term, this may not be a great bet. Karkera says he sees good potential for the stock, amongst larger institutional investors. &ldquo;The sector warrants a lot of institutional interest and these investors are willing to take a longer-term risk on the sector which is in an expansion mode,&rdquo; he said.'], ['moneycontrol', \"Hike's Rush Gaming Universe axes 55 jobs as 28% GST bites\", \"Rush Gaming Universe, a casual skill gaming platform from Kavin Bharti Mittal's Hike, is laying off around 55 employees, of which 24 are non-full time employees.

Soybean is a crucial kharif oilseed crop and accounts for around 30% of India's oilseed basket. The government has deferred the implementation of Cotton Bales (Quality Control) Order, 2023 to Nov 27 from Sep 1, according to a gazette notification. According to a notification issued on Feb 28, the new norm will require cotton bales to comply with the quality control order of the Bureau of Indian Standards. Earlier, the Cotton Association of India and the Tamilnadu Spinning Mills Association had written to the government to defer the implementation of a quality control order that was supposed to come into effect from Sep 1. The associations have said domestic ginners do not have adequate infrastructure to test 5% of cotton bales, as per the quality control order. Natural moisture in the lint during rainy season is about 10-12% and 15- 25% in Kapas, which is not in the hands of ginners to control moisture in the lint cotton to 8%. The associations said that even the same crop, grown at the same location and in the same environment, may not have the same quality and the same specifications.

In this context, experts advise investing in debt funds investing in bonds, maturing in the short term.\\n\\nInflation remains a key concern\\n\\nThough inflation came down to 4.3 percent in May 2023, the inflation numbers are expected to be higher in July and August. Food prices remain a key variable and can push up inflation. The possibility of El Nino impacting the distribution of rains, and, thereby, farm output, can further push up prices. Globally, food and crude oil prices have inched up. Price of brent crude oil went to $87 per barrel on August 10, 2023, from $72 per barrel on May 31, 2023. These indicate a possibility of upward movement in inflation numbers.\\n\\nALSO READ: 3 RBI announcements that will turbocharge UPI, UPI Lite\\n\\nAccordingly, the RBI has revised the inflation expectation for FY 2023-2024 to 5.4 percent, which was set at 5.1 percent in the June MPC review. &ldquo;We have to stand in readiness to go beyond, keeping Arjuna&rsquo;s eye on the inflation front, deploying policy instruments, if necessary. I reiterate what I said in my June policy statement: bringing headline inflation within the tolerance band is not enough; we need to remain firmly focused on aligning inflation to the target of 4 percent,&rdquo; the Governor said in his address announcing the MPC review outcome.\\n\\nAs a temporary measure to deal with excess liquidity in the banking system, the RBI has also directed scheduled banks to maintain an incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19, 2023 and July 28, 2023. This will be done, effective from the fortnight beginning August 12, 2023. This will be reviewed on September 8, 2023 or earlier. The governor further maintained that the existing cash reserve ratio (CRR) remains unchanged at 4.5 percent and there will be adequate liquidity in the system to meet the credit needs of the economy.\\n\\nALSO READ: What NRIs must keep in mind when investing their money\\n\\nHow does that impact debt fund investors?\\n\\nThe RBI&rsquo;s commitment to control inflation indicates that it is in no hurry to cut interest rates. The bond yields are expected to remain at the current higher levels for a longer period. Deepak Agrawal, CIO, Fixed Income, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company, says: &ldquo;The RBI prefers to be in a &lsquo;wait-and-watch&rsquo; mode to check if the recent food price inflation is getting generalised and prefers to keep rates on hold and to keep the monetary policy unchanged. The rate is likely to stay on hold for the rest of CY2023.&rdquo;\\n\\nIf the RBI reverses the I-CRR by September, with a view to infusing liquidity in the September review or earlier, then that should soften short-term bond yields, other things remaining the same.\\n\\nShort-term bond yields in a sweet spot\\n\\nThe benchmark 10-year bond yield remained flat at 7.17 after the MPC announcement. This may go up by a bit, if inflation actually goes up, as Das said the RBI expects.\\n\\nHere is why short-term bond funds are comparatively less impacted than long-term bond funds. Investments in long-duration bonds expose investors to interest rate risk. When compared to this, short-term bonds appear attractive as one and two-year bond yields quote around 7 percent.\\n\\nDharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist, CRISIL, says, &ldquo;Mint Road seems staunchly focused on keeping consumer inflation within the 4 percent target, while standing pat on rates and monetary policy stance. The introduction of an incremental cash reserve ratio could temporarily harden short-term rates.&rdquo;\\n\\nALSO READ: Property insurance across borders: Local firms better equipped to provide tailor-made policies\\n\\nAt present, it may not be the best time to look at debt schemes focusing on long duration. Instead, this could be an opportunity to look at debt schemes focusing on the shorter end of the yield curve.\\n\\nWhat should you do?\\n\\nAccording to the monthly data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), liquid and money market funds saw net inflows of Rs 51,938 crore and Rs 8,608 crore, respectively.\\n\\nAfter witnessing a net outflow of Rs 14,135 crore in June (the end of the quarter), debt-oriented schemes received a robust net inflow of Rs 61,400 crore in July. This clearly highlights that investors are more comfortable investing at the short end of the yield curve. This can be a good time to invest in short-duration debt funds, if you intend to hold your investments for 2-3 years. For those looking to invest for less than a year, investments in liquid, low-duration and money-market funds can be considered.

The yield, which lenders use to price rates on mortgages and other loans, was at 4.02% in midday trading Thursday.\\n\\nHigh inflation drove the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022, lifting the fed funds rate to the highest level in 22 years. Inflation has come down steadily since last summer, and many analysts believe the Fed has reached the end of its rate hikes.\\n\\nMortgage rates don&rsquo;t necessarily mirror the Fed&rsquo;s rate increases, but tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Investors&rsquo; expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Fed does with interest rates can influence rates on home loans.\\n\\nThe average rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with those refinancing their homes, rose to 6.34% from 6.25% last week.

We will try and explain below.\\n\\nDifference between I-CRR and CRR\\n\\nI-CRR is similar to the CRR, wherein banks need to set aside a certain portion of their money with the RBI. They do not earn any interest on this. Likewise, with the I-CRR, banks need to set aside an additional 10 percent of the NDTL garnered between May 19 and July 28.\\n\\nWhy has the RBI announced the I-CRR?\\n\\nThe central bank has announced the I-CRR with an aim to manage the higher surplus liquidity sloshing about in the economy following the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system (after they were withdrawn from circulation).\\n\\n&ldquo;This measure is intended to absorb the surplus liquidity generated by various factors, including the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system,&rdquo; RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said at the press conference following the monetary policy committee meeting.\\n\\nIn the last few months, the liquidity in the banking system has risen sharply post the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 banknotes, the transfer of RBI&rsquo;s surplus to the government, an uptick in government spending, and capital inflows.\\n\\nTo mitigate this, the central bank has conducted various variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions of different tenures, but received a muted response from the banks, as they preferred holding on to the liquidity to avoid seeking funds later under the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF). The MSF allows banks to borrow from the RBI in emergencies at a rate higher than the repo.\\n\\nSince June, the central bank has conducted 16 VRRR auctions for Rs 18 lakh crore. However, banks parked only Rs 7,73,023 crore in these auctions.\\n\\nHow much money will be parked in I-CRR?\\n\\nDas said that per the RBI&rsquo;s internal calculations, a little over Rs 1 lakh crore will be parked in I-CRR, which will accordingly lower the surplus liquidity in the banking system, which currently stands at around Rs 2.11 lakh crore.\\n\\nAccording to Esha Khanna, Associate Professor, NMIMS Sarla Anil Modi School of Economics, this move may slightly tighten the liquidity situation in the short term and affect short-term call rates.\\n\\nHow will it impact systemic liquidity?\\n\\nMost money market dealers and experts said the I-CRR will have some impact on the banking system liquidity, but it will continue to be in surplus by over Rs 1 lakh crore for the next couple of months.\\n\\n&ldquo;An ICRR of 10 percent can take out a little over Rs1 lakh crore from the banking system. Despite this, the system liquidity will remain in surplus by more than Rs 1 lakh crore for the next 1-2 months,&rdquo; said Pankaj Pathak, Fund Manager-Fixed Income, Quantum AMC.\\n\\nBut the I-CRR will impact short-term rates, which may harden by 15-20 basis points (bps).\\n\\n&ldquo;We expect the short-term rates of money market instruments like treasury bills, call money rates, and commercial paper to increase by 15-20 bps in the near term,&rdquo; said Anil Gupta, Senior Vice President, Co-Group Head - Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA Ltd.\\n\\nWill it impact lending and deposit rates?\\n\\nExperts believe that there will be no major impact on the deposit and lending rates because the RBI Governor has said that the central bank will ensure there is adequate liquidity in the system.\\n\\n&ldquo;We will ensure there is enough liquidity in the system for banks to continue lending,&rdquo; Das said during the conference.\\n\\nWill RBI continue VRRR auctions?\\n\\nDas also clarified that even though the central bank has announced the I-CRR, VRRR auctions will continue to be the main tool for draining excess liquidity.\\n\\n&ldquo;VRRR (auctions) will continue,&rdquo; Das said, adding that the VRRR system will release about Rs 93,000 crore on August 10.'], ['moneycontrol', 'Manufacturing: The new hot stock picking ground for MFs.

But excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation matched the smallest monthly increase in nearly two years. The inflation figure the government reported Thursday showed that consumer prices increased 3.2% from a year earlier. That was up from a 3% annual rise in June, which was the lowest rate in more than two years.\\n\\nThe July inflation figure remained far below last year&rsquo;s peak of 9.1%, though still above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s 2% target. The Fed, economists and investors, though, pay particular attention to the core inflation figures for signs of where inflationary pressures might be headed. From June to July, core inflation remained a tame 0.2%. Thursday&rsquo;s price data will be among the key barometers the Fed will weigh in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates.\\n\\nIn its drive to tame inflation, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate 11 times since March 2022 to a 22-year high. A jump in energy prices has rekindled some of the inflation pressures underlying the economy. Gasoline prices have surged nearly 30 cents over the past month to a national average of $3.83 a gallon, according to AAA. Economists say that in the fight to conquer inflation, easy progress has likely already been achieved. Gasoline prices, for example, though liable to bounce around from month to month, have already plunged from a peak national average of more than $5 a gallon, which was reached in June of last year after Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nMuch of the inflationary surge that began in 2021 was caused by clogged supply chains: Ports, factories and freight yards were overwhelmed by the explosive economic rebound from the pandemic recession of 2020. The result was delays, parts shortages and higher prices. But supply-chain backlogs have eased in the past year, sharply reducing upward pressure on goods prices.\\n\\nPrices of long-lasting manufactured goods actually dipped in June. Now, the Fed faces a daunting problem: persistent inflationary pressures in service businesses &mdash; restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues and the like &mdash; where wages represent a substantial share of costs. Worker shortages have led many of these services companies to sharply raise pay. Last week, for example, the Labor Department reported that average hourly wages rose 4.4% in July from a year earlier, more than expected.\\n\\nTo cover their higher labor costs, companies have typically raised their prices, thereby fueling inflation. Another factor working against continued declines in year-over-year inflation rates is that prices soared in the first half of last year before slowing in the second half. So any price increase in July would have the effect of boosting the year-over-year inflation rate. Still, economists caution against reading too much into one month of numbers.\\n\\nMany of them expect inflation to continue trending lower. Used car prices, which had skyrocketed after the pandemic, have been edging down: They dropped 5.1% in July from a year earlier to $29,198, according to Edmunds.com. July of last year was near the peak of used-car price spikes, resulting from a scarcity of new vehicles caused by a global computer-chip shortage. Buyers who wanted new vehicles but couldn&rsquo;t find them entered the used market, sending used prices sharply higher.\\n\\nThis year, though, used vehicle prices began to drop once automakers managed to acquire more chips and could produce more new vehicles. Many shoppers who were forced to buy used are now back in the new-vehicle market. Used-vehicle prices are expected to decline, at least modestly, through the year. Despite chronic concerns about higher labor costs, one closely watched measure of wages and salaries &mdash; the Labor Department&rsquo;s employment cost index &mdash; grew more slowly from April through June.\\n\\nExcluding government jobs, employee pay rose 1%, less than the 1.2% increase in the first three months of 2023. Compared with a year earlier, wages and salaries grew 4.6%, down from a year-over-year increase of 5.1% in the first quarter. Rents, which had soared after the pandemic, are also cooling. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote this week that &amp;quot;year-over-year shelter inflation will continue to slow through late 2024 and may even turn negative by mid-2024.&amp;quot;\\n\\nFed officials will have plenty of data to absorb before deciding whether to continue raising rates. Thursday&rsquo;s report is the first of two CPI numbers the policymakers will see before their next meeting on Sept. 19-20. In addition, their favoured inflation gauge, called the personal income expenditures price index, comes out on Aug. 31. And the August jobs report will be released on Sept. 1. Many economists and market analysts think the Fed&rsquo;s most recent rate hike in July will prove to be its last: Nearly 87% of traders expect no Fed hike next month, according to the CME Group&rsquo;s FedWatch Tool.']], [['moneycontrol', \"Japan's BoJ miscommunicates with easy money policy under pressure\", \"With few exceptions, the most prominent central banks have retired from the business of providing detailed projections of where interest rates are headed. The costs of being wrong in an era of worrisome inflation were too great. Japan is trying something new: forward&nbsp;misguidance. Unsettling surprises are a feature of the choices the Bank of Japan has made over the past decade, rather than a bug. Dismantling ultra-loose money and the paraphernalia that has supported it means that communications accidents like the one&nbsp;that&nbsp;rocked global markets&nbsp;recently are bound to happen. If they were, indeed, an accident.\\n\\nInvestors should brace for more adventures on the road to less easy money. With inflation now off the floor &mdash;&nbsp;there are arguments about how much momentum prices have &mdash;&nbsp;the desired destination is likely an end to vigorous policing&nbsp;of&nbsp;yields on government bonds. And quite possibly, an end to negative official rates. That&nbsp;won't happen overnight, but the odds of a graceful exit are long. Market sensitivity to tweaks in BOJ policy is extreme because officials are seeking to directly manage the value of securities, rather than guide toward their view.\\n\\nFew BOJ watchers predicted Governor Kazuo Ueda would let long-term market rates increase at the conclusion of the July 27-28 meeting.&nbsp;Ueda had used&nbsp;a&nbsp;dovish tone earlier in July, affirming at the meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers in India that things were set to stay the same. &ldquo;Unless the premise is shifted, the whole story will remain unchanged,&rdquo;&nbsp;he&nbsp;said. Reports from inside the bank seemed to back this narrative; more than 80 percent of economists expected no policy change, even a tweak.\\n\\nThat was until 2 am, Tokyo time,&nbsp;on the morning of July 28, when a story&nbsp;in the Nikkei newspaper hinted that rates on 10-year Japanese government debt would be allowed to go over 0.5 percent. It was the second time in Ueda&rsquo;s short reign that Japanese media&nbsp;appeared&nbsp;to be in possession of information from inside the gathering.\\n\\nEven then, traders didn&rsquo;t have the full story, with the report carrying no mention of the 1&nbsp;percent ceiling. When the official announcement hit after an interminable wait &mdash; the BOJ&nbsp;still&nbsp;does not give a time in advance for when policy will be announced, leaving&nbsp;dealers&nbsp;fruitlessly refreshing screens &mdash; it confused the market with its mention of three different levels for the 10-year yield (&ldquo;around zero,&rdquo; a 0.5 percent &ldquo;range&rdquo; and the 1 percent &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; at which the bank would step in). Investors are still debating what the move means.\\n\\nThe July decision &ldquo;created too many interpretations, because it was just too complex and everybody understood it in a different way,&rdquo; former board member Sayuri Shirai said in an interview. &ldquo;I kind of expected that Ueda-san would be a bit clearer.&rdquo;\\n\\nIt&rsquo;s far from the first time the bank has struggled to communicate a change in yield-curve control. In fact, every single time the&nbsp;BOJ&nbsp;has changed the way it implements YCC, it has done so&nbsp;differently, going from an ambiguous range to a defined one, and now back to ambiguity.\\n\\nIn an era when communications are a central bank&rsquo;s foremost tool, the data-driven Ueda was meant to bring clarity. The shock-and-awe strategy of his&nbsp;predecessor, Haruhiko Kuroda, was deliberately designed to stun the market and show he meant business in a way that Masaaki Shirakawa, who led the bank before him, was widely judged not to have. But observers had tired of it by the end of Kuroda&rsquo;s long decade in charge. Now, Ueda faces the same credibility deficit.\\n\\nWhile misunderstanding around the BOJ&rsquo;s policy partly reflects ignorance of how the bank works and the differing ways in which Japan&rsquo;s economy operates, Ueda has deepened distrust of whether the bank says what it means and means what it says. A recent comment illuminates this lack of clarity. &ldquo;There is no specific level in my mind at this stage,&rdquo; Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida&nbsp;said&nbsp;last week, in response to a question&nbsp;about when the BOJ would step into&nbsp;the market for 10-year bonds. But then he offered a telling comment: &ldquo;I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it even if there was one.&rdquo;\\n\\nThe BOJ is likely sincere when it says the 2 percent price goal is still some way off, even if one member seemingly believes it&rsquo;s on the horizon. But the head fakes&nbsp;are making it difficult to know what it truly believes.\\n\\nThe need for circumspection, to put it charitably, may just be inherent in the whole YCC project. Krishna Guha, who covers global policy at Evercore ISI,&nbsp;has likened the approach to a shift in exchange-rate regimes. You never talk about it in advance for fear that speculators get too far ahead and, consequently, ruin the necessary element of surprise. There's something to that analogy. During the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis, the&nbsp;modus operandi of governments when faced with questions of devaluation was to deny or obfuscate. Same with Latin America in the following years.\\n\\nThere&rsquo;s&nbsp;a further comparison:&nbsp;capital controls. In the leadup to Malaysia's decision in September 1998 to slap restrictions on the flow of money out of the country, ministers would discourage discussion of the shift. Shirai is among those who argue that YCC itself was a fudge in the first place to make up for the deep unpopularity of negative rates, which she voted against in early 2016. The BOJ is still working to extricate itself from that decision.\\n\\nJapan isn't about to have a currency or debt crisis; the BOJ itself owns a swathe of the domestic bond market after decades of on-again-off-again quantitative easing. But a communications crisis is something else. It would be a tragedy if the&nbsp;mistrust&nbsp;and skepticism that pervaded the&nbsp;end of&nbsp;his predecessor's&nbsp;second term come to define Ueda's tenure just a few months after taking the oath of office.\\n\\nSuch are the thrills and spills of unconventional monetary policy.

The domestic currency opened at 82.24 and touched a low of 82.27 -- a level last seen on 12 July.\\n\\nIndia's benchmark Sensex and Nifty lost around 0.7 percent each on Thursday. Sensex in pre-opening was trading flat from its previous close.\\n\\nA note from advisory CR Forex read, &amp;quot;The Indian Rupee is likely to face the heat of global risk-aversion could open lower around 82.25-30 levels, tracking broader strength in the DXY. Yesterday, the Rupee did not benefit despite a weaker dollar globally on the back of defense-related payment outflow, and the routine month-end dollar demand was also observed. However, the RBI might intervene in the spot market by selling dollars to curb unprecedented depreciation beyond the 82.50 to 82.70 zone.&amp;quot;\\n\\nThe recent release of upbeat U.S. economic data supported the dollar index, as a possibility of further interest rate hike by the U.S. Fed in the September policy meeting has increased, analysts said. The crude oil, which was trading above $80 a barrel also dampened sentiments among traders.\\n\\nOvernight, as expected, the European Central Bank (ECB) hiked the interest rate by 25 bps, thus bringing the deposit rate to 3.75 percent. ECB's President Ms Lagarde was somewhat dovish in her statements as she acknowledged that the European economic situation was deteriorating and there will be two inflation readings between now and September to assess the situation so far as the next meeting in September is concerned.\\n\\nAsian currencies were trading mixed. The Japanese yen rose 0.25 percent, Thai Baht up 0.2 percent, China Offshore gained 0.19 percent, Singapore dollar 0.08 percent.

Following suit, Power Grid Corp Of India and Hindustan Unilever Ltd received ratings of 14 buy, 5 hold, and 3 sells, and 29 buy, 13 hold, and 3 sells, respectively. A month ago, these two companies had 18 buy, 4 holds, and zero sells, and 36 buys, 7 holds, and 2 sells, respectively. All these three stocks have fallen over 5-6 percent each in the last one month.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to analysts, Infosys is projected to face continued stock pressure for the next two quarters. The company has revised its revenue guidance twice in a span of three months due to weakened demand. The recent wave of high-level managerial resignations has further complicated the situation. In a soft-demand environment, Infosys might be losing market share, as indicated by its subdued growth guidance for 2023-24. The series of senior-level departures in recent quarters raises concerns about the company's stability and its effectiveness in managing key verticals, contributing to the stock's ongoing underperformance, according to a recent Jefferies report.\\n\\nPower Grid has recently disclosed its financial results for the quarter ending June 2023, indicating a modest 1&nbsp;percent uptick in revenue. This growth was hindered by factors such as the adverse influence of tariff differentials, sluggish expansion in asset capitalisation, and a significant 46 percent YoY decline in revenue from the consultancy segment. Nonetheless, the consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) demonstrated enhancement due to improved efficiencies. On a consolidated basis, there was a slight 5 percent decline in net profit compared to the previous year, primarily attributed to a notable decrease in the profit of the consultancy segment and a nearly 20 percent reduction in other income.\\n\\nHUL's earnings for the June quarter were weaker than expected. Although there has been some improvement in gross margin buildup compared to analysts&rsquo; expectations, the acceleration in volume is taking longer than anticipated due to the gradual normalisation of consumer habits, JM Financial said in its recent note. The management foresees this adjustment lasting for a span of two to three quarters. Despite the company's optimism regarding rural demand recovery, increased weather-related risks have become more prominent. Notably, heightened competitive pressures have emerged, fuelled by the assertiveness of smaller players in specific categories and an elevated intensity in media competition, the JM Financial report added.\\n\\n&amp;quot;In FY24E, the projected outlook entails single-digit sales growth centered on volume expansion. Although the company targets substantial gross margin enhancement, this progress could be counterbalanced by the need to raise Advertising &amp;amp;amp; Promotion (A&amp;amp;amp;P) spending, which has declined by over 350 basis points over the last three years. While the potential for a double-digit return from the stock is recognized for the upcoming year, the valuation multiples might be constrained due to the tougher operational landscape,&amp;quot; according to the JM Financial report.\\n\\nUPL Ltd, Tinan Co Ltd, and Ultratech Cement Ltd saw huge downgrades as well. As per Moneycontrol's analyst call tracker, UPL received 21 buy calls, 6 holds, and 2 sell calls, compared to the previous 25 buy calls and 2 each of hold and sell calls a month ago. Titan garnered 23 buy calls, 8 holds, and 4 sells, whereas it had previously secured 27 buy calls, 5 holds, and 3 sell ratings. Similarly, Ultratech Cement received 33 buy calls, 9 holds, and 4 sells, versus the earlier 37 buy calls and 4 each of hold and sell calls.\\n\\nIn the June quarter, UPL Ltd encountered substantial setbacks in both its profits and revenue, mainly due to a nearly double-digit decrease in sales volume. The company responded to aggressive pricing from Chinese sellers by implementing significant price reductions in international markets, according to a Motilal Oswal report. Amid the industry's slowdown, UPL expressed its intent to prioritise profitability and cash conservation. It also anticipates a reduction in working capital days in the future. Confronting formidable global challenges during April-June, UPL has revised its revenue and operating profit guidance for the fiscal year 2023-24 (April-March). The adjustment is notable, with projected revenue growth now ranging from 1&nbsp;percent to 5&nbsp;percent, compared to the earlier estimate of 6 percent-10 percent. Furthermore, EBITDA is forecasted to increase by 3 percent to 7 percent, in contrast to the previously expected rise of 8 percent-12 percent.\\n\\nUltratech Cement's earnings slightly missed estimates. As per a UBS report, there are concerns among industry observers about an anticipated demand slowdown post the upcoming general elections in May 2024. This is compounded by a swift surge in new capacity that could surpass medium-term demand. The industry is expected to witness around 110 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of new capacity entering the market within the next 2.5 years, in contrast to an incremental demand of 70mtpa.&nbsp;UBS forecasts that cement players might adopt aggressive pricing strategies to safeguard their market share, especially with the intensifying competition due to Adani group's entry into the sector.\"], ['moneycontrol', 'Investors Brace for Fallout From Ecuador Candidate&rsquo;s Killing', 'Fernando Villavicencio, an anti-graft crusader and journalist, was murdered while leaving a political rally at school in the capital city of Quito late on Wednesday. Warring cocaine cartels have turned the once-peaceful country into one of the most violent places in the world, making law and order central to all candidates running in the upcoming elections.\\n\\nAs the nation reels, investors are looking for potential unrest, and trying to assess how the shocking events will impact voters ahead of the Aug. 20 election. Villavicencio was the second-most favoured candidate behind socialist Luisa Gonzalez, according to a poll released Wednesday. Conservative former sniper Jan Topic placed third, followed by Indigenous leader Yaku Perez and former vice president Otto Sonnenholzner.\\n\\n&ldquo;This will favour the extremes,&rdquo; said Ramiro Blazquez, head of research and strategy at BancTrust.\\n\\nThe country&rsquo;s assets are already trading at distressed levels, after dollar bonds lost more than 25% this year, one of the worst performances in emerging markets globally. Losses accelerated after voters rejected referendum proposals and political opponents mounted an impeachment campaign against President Guillermo Lasso, prompting him to close Congress and triggering a snap vote.\\n\\nDistressed Debt\\nThe selloff has left bonds due in 2035 and 2040, some of the nation&rsquo;s most liquid, trading at 30 to 35 cents on the dollar, levels they&rsquo;ve been fairly steady at since March. The 2035 notes were quoted at&nbsp;34.34&nbsp;cents and the 2040s at&nbsp;31.21&nbsp;cents as of 9 a.m. in London on Thursday, according to indicative pricing on Bloomberg. Earlier on Wednesday, JPMorgan had recommended&nbsp;an overweight position&nbsp;on the nation&rsquo;s debt.\\n\\n&ldquo;There has been relative social balance in Ecuador since Lasso used constitutional powers to dissolve the government and call for elections,&rdquo; said Oren Barack, managing director of fixed income at New York-based Alliance Global Partners. &ldquo;With very few details over the assassination, social unrest and protests are likely to occur over the coming days.&rdquo;\\n\\nEcuador has a checkered financial history. Since its independence, it has defaulted on its external debt 11 times, most recently at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. While the investment scenario improved under Lasso, with international reserves near record highs, minimal debt service payments and a narrowing fiscal deficit, the return of a hard left administration could upend the outlook for markets.\\n\\nThat possibility has likely diminished with Villavicencio&rsquo;s murder, according to Katrina Butt, senior economist for emerging markets at AllianceBernstein in New York.\\n\\n&ldquo;It might provide more support in consolidation of the center-right candidate,&rdquo; she said, referring to Sonnenholzner. It could also benefit Topic&rsquo;s security-focused campaign but would be unlikely to provide a boost to the most leftist candidate, Perez, whose platform had little overlap with Villavicencio&rsquo;s.\\n\\nEcuador&rsquo;s election is one of a trio of Latin American votes this month in which crime and security are major issues. Argentina holds primaries on August 13 and Guatemala holds a runoff presidential vote on Aug. 20.']], [], [], []]\n"
