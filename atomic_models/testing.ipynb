      " \n",
      " The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on August 10 made an upward revision to its inflation forecast for 2023-24, raising it by 30 basis points to 5.4 percent.\n",
      " \n",
      " In his address on the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) latest decision to leave the&nbsp;key policy repo rate unchanged at&nbsp;6.5 percent for the third time in a row, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the risks to the inflation forecasts were &amp;quot;evenly balanced&amp;quot;.\n",
      " \n",
      " Driving the full-year inflation forecast hike was that for the second quarter, which is now seen at 6.2 percent - a full hundred basis points higher than previously hoped - due to a sharp increase in vegetable prices.\n",
      " \n",
      " Also Read:&nbsp;FinMin says rise in food inflation warrants guarded approach by govt, RBI\n",
      " \n",
      " &amp;quot;The month of July has witnessed accentuation of food inflation, primarily on account of vegetables. The spike in tomato prices and further increase in prices of cereals and pulses have contributed to this. Consequently, a substantial increase in headline inflation would occur in the near-term,&amp;quot; Das said in his address announcing the MPC's decision.\n",
      " \n",
      " The quarterly break-up of the inflation forecast is as follows:\n",
      " \n",
      " &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&nbsp;July-September 2023 Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation forecast raised to 6.2 percent from 5.2 percent\n",
      " \n",
      " &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; October-December 2023 CPI inflation forecast raised to 5.7 percent from 5.4 percent\n",
      " \n",
      " &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; January-March 2024 CPI inflation forecast retained at 5.2 percent\n",
      " \n",
      " &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; April-June 2024 CPI inflation forecast pegged at 5.2 percent\n",
      " \n",
      "  Source: Reserve Bank of India\n",
      " \n",
      " As is visible in the forecasts, the huge jump in&nbsp;inflation in July-September is expected to recede quickly, with the RBI governor saying that past trends suggested&nbsp;vegetable prices may see a &amp;quot;significant correction&amp;quot; after a few months.\n",
      " \n",
      " &amp;quot;Given the likely short-term nature of these shocks, monetary policy can look through high inflation prints&nbsp;caused by such shocks for some time,&amp;quot; Das added.\n",
      " \n",
      " CPI inflation is set to shoot up in July - data for which will be released on August 14 - and cross the upper bound of the Indian central bank's 2-6 percent tolerance range for the first time in five months.\n",

      " Article 2 - Headline: Three factors that prevent India and China from getting close\n",
      " \n",
      " Both India and China lie at the heart of the geopolitical churn in the Indo-Pacific, with their bilateral relationship holding significant implications for the future of the world order. While India is pursuing a policy of multi-alignment, it increasingly seems to be caught between two emerging power centres. On one side is a rising China, which is seeking to actively reshape the international order to facilitate its rise to the centre-stage of world affairs; on the other is the US, which is working to boost domestic strength, revitalise old alliances and fashion new partnerships in order to sustain its preeminence.\n",
      " \n",
      " So what does this mean for the relationship between India and China? After all, China is not only India&rsquo;s largest neighbour but a key trading partner. At the same time, the two sides increasingly appear to be moving towards greater friction and hostility along the disputed boundary. Will the intensified tensions result in more conflict, even if of just low-intensity variety? Or is there a possibility for some sort of new peaceful equilibrium,&nbsp;perhaps even friendship, between the two?\n",
      " \n",
      " Intersecting Zones Of Influence\n",
      " \n",
      " To my mind, three structural factors make it difficult for India and China to get close.\n",
      " \n",
      " First, as both have risen over the past three decades, their interests have not only expanded but also now increasingly intersect across each other&rsquo;s traditional zones of influence. Beijing&rsquo;s intensified engagement in the Indian subcontinent and Delhi&rsquo;s more public expression of concern around issues of the South China Sea are examples of this.\n",
      " \n",
      " What&rsquo;s more, both sides have greater capabilities today and have demonstrated increased political willingness to pursue those interests. An example of this is the increased military capacity along the disputed border leading to the two forces brushing up against each other more frequently.\n",
      " \n",
      " Growing Power And Asymmetry\n",
      " \n",
      " Secondly, as their&nbsp;power has grown&nbsp;so has the asymmetry between the two. This differential has resulted in Beijing being more risk-tolerant and resorting to greater coercion to confine India within the subcontinent.\n",
      " \n",
      " China&rsquo;s common refrain that India should put the boundary issue in its &ldquo;proper place in bilateral relations&rdquo; and accept the coercively-altered status quo in Eastern Ladakh is an example of its view that India should acknowledge the power differential and act accordingly.\n",
      " \n",
      " Such an accession will not only be politically damaging for any Indian establishment but also strategically imprudent. In response, India has sought to resist while talking, de-risk in certain domains and counterbalance with actors like the US and Australia.\n",
      " \n",
      " US-India Proximity\n",
      " \n",
      " This feeds into the third structural factor, i.e., the deepening competition between China and the US. China is quite anxious and vocal about its displeasure with India&rsquo;s unprecedented proximity with the US.\n",
      " \n",
      " A Delhi closely&nbsp;aligned with Washington&nbsp;presents a formidable hurdle for Beijing&rsquo;s global ambitions. But Chinese scholars also acknowledge that the Washington-Delhi embrace is not necessarily of an alliance variety; there exist limitations, grievances, complications and divergences of interests.\n",
      " \n",
      " Consequently, Beijing repeatedly urges Delhi to view bilateral relations in the context of the once-in-a-century changes taking place in the world and think of bilateral cooperation from the perspective of their respective national rejuvenation. Yet, there is precious little that China has done to demonstrate appreciation for India&rsquo;s interests and aspirations.\n",
      " \n",
      " Its policy has predominantly relied on coercion rather than accommodation. This has further damaged the already low levels of trust between the elites and populations on both sides.\n",
      " \n",
      " Sliding Public Opinion\n",
      " \n",
      " For instance, the last formal meeting between Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping was in October 2019. The informal chat they had in Bali last year didn&rsquo;t move the needle at all. Public opinion, meanwhile, has also sunk. Indians have historically held a rather negative view of China, though there was a brief period of positivity around China&rsquo;s development achievements around 2006-2008.\n",
      " \n",
      " This sentiment has since faded, with recent Pew polling data showing that negative opinions about China in India rose from 46&nbsp;percent in 2019 to 67 percent in 2023. Other surveys also reflect this trend, which has sharpened since the events of 2020.\n",

      " Article 3 - Headline: Does money win the war &mdash; Inferences from the Russian push in defence expenditure\n",
      " \n",
      " As the Russia-Ukraine war continues unabated, both countries are exploring ways and means to gain an upper hand. The latest is the so-called quantum jump in Russia&rsquo;s defence expenditure (defex). According to a recent&nbsp;Reuters report, Russia has nearly doubled its defex target&nbsp;to more than $102 billion in the current year. The announcement is not surprising since Russia is on a spending spree to finance its war activities and has apparently spent the allocated budget by June this year. However, it is debatable if a quantum jump alone would enable Russia to gain&nbsp;a&nbsp;decisive advantage over Ukraine.\n",
      " \n",
      " War-led Spending\n",
      " \n",
      " According to the&nbsp;2023 SIPRI Factsheet&nbsp;on Trends in Military Expenditure, Russia emerged as the third largest spender (from fifth in 2021) after the US and China, spending more than $86 billion and accounting for 4.1 percent of its GDP in 2022.&nbsp;SIPRI data, therefore, is at variance with Reuter&rsquo;s claim, since there is an increase of only 20 percent over last year&rsquo;s figures. Hitherto, Russia is an autocratic, militarised state with overgrown military establishments, perpetual warfare, high-level military mobilisation and a consequential larger share for the military in resource allocation. For example, in 2022, only seven countries allocated more defex as a proportion of GDP than Russia. Further, Russia continues to monetise some portions of oil exports and, therefore, would most likely sustain the revenue model for its war activities and allocate even higher portions of GDP to&nbsp;defence&nbsp;in future.\n",
      " \n",
      " However, Ukraine has also pushed up its defex. It moved from the 36th position in 2021 to the 11th in 2022, spending $44 billion. This was a 640 percent increase over its 2021 defex figures. A balance of fortunes would possibly emerge only if there is a huge asymmetry between the two countries. That is not happening since Ukraine was also able to raise a significant amount through military assistance and loans from NATO countries.&nbsp;The US, for example, has committed more than $40 billion in security assistance&nbsp;alone since February 2022. Another $35 billion stands committed for humanitarian and financial aid. A matching contribution has also been committed by the European Union institutions and non-US NATO members. Therefore, Russian defex increases are meaningless.\n",
      " \n",
      " Money Just One Factor\n",
      " \n",
      " Hitherto, money is only one of the numerous factors in warfare. For example, America&rsquo;s defence budget is 39 percent of the global defence expenditure and is three times more than China, the next in the pecking order. Yet, America has not been able to win any war in recent times after the 1991 Gulf War success. Saudi Arabia is the fifth-largest military spender and is either the largest or second-largest importer of weapons in the international arms market. Yet, Saudi Arabia has failed to metamorphose itself into a recognised military power in the Gulf and West Asia region. It emerges, therefore, that there are significant non-monetary factors that decide the fate of contemporary wars.\n",
      " \n",
      " Unfortunately, Russia has many such problems that undermine the budgetary increases. First, Russia does not have a conducive military culture for carrying out successful war activities. Years of combat experience notwithstanding, Russian soldiers are fatigued. While Russia has an advanced military-industrial complex (MIC) and has been a lead arms supplier, the personnel side of military modernisation remains in shambles. Soldiers are not getting paid in time and efforts to push up military reforms were never taken seriously. The military leadership is uninspiring, best evident in the&nbsp;open revolt by a private army&nbsp;against them some time ago.\n",
      " \n",
      " Hurt By Sanctions\n",
      " \n",
      " Second, Russia&rsquo;s supply chain economy for delivering quantitative and qualitative military hardware is increasingly coming under challenge. From being an arms exporter, Russia is now desperate to import vital spare parts for its arsenals. Its domestic MIC is not able to produce many of those items despite liberal budgetary support and manpower training in weapons production. Part of the reason is the tightening of global economic sanctions on Russia and its extermination from all international arms markets.\n",
      " \n",
      " Third, despite being an established military power, Russia is not able to come out with disruptive military innovations or technologies to gain a significant advantage over Ukraine. Its Air Force failed to make a decisive dent into Ukraine&rsquo;s air space. The missile forces too have not made any significant damage after early impact. Russia, it seems, is a victim of overconfidence and poor strategic instincts. On the contrary, Ukraine has won back sizeable portions of territory from the Russian military. In recent times, it has taken the war to Russian territory, hitting portions of Moscow and sea ports in&nbsp;drone attacks from far-off distances.\n",
      " \n",
      " Contemporary wars are protracted wars. Even great powers are not able to clinch an outright victory. In uncertain war atmospherics, overt emphasis on defence spending is more about politics and marketing than an effective tool in war economy management. Therefore, it is debatable if defex increases alone will induce favourable military fortunes for Russia. At best, it would perpetuate Russia&rsquo;s military economy without ensuring a decisive outcome in the ongoing war against Ukraine.\n",

      " \n",
      " It was on May 10, 2023, exactly three months ago, that the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted the voluntary insolvency petition of Go First thus triggering a moratorium on assets and liabilities. In its order, it also barred the company from retrenching employees so that the airline was maintained as a going concern to make the revival possible.\n",
      " \n",
      " Even though the Resolution Professional (RP) has been at work with the active support of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the airline continues to remain grounded. The RP&rsquo;s optimism on revival, even as most industry observers found it to be misplaced, was reflected in the public notice issued to invite&nbsp;expressions of interest&nbsp;from potential buyers with August 9, 2023 as the deadline. Developments such as the&nbsp;CoC agreeing to provide interim funding&nbsp;of\n",
      " Rs&nbsp;425 crore and the DGCA according approval to the revival plan, with riders, after scaling down the number of aircraft that were likely available and could be deployed, lent some hope. This was all during the month of July.\n",
      " \n",
      " Two developments of this week &mdash; the&nbsp;refusal of the Supreme Court of India&nbsp;to overrule or interfere in the proceedings on the petition of aircraft lessors in the Delhi High Court and the extension of the deadline for submission of expression of interest by a month to September 8, 2023 are enough indications that revival of Go First is not on the horizon any time soon.\n",
      " \n",
      " Aircraft Hold The Key\n",
      " \n",
      " What is it that is proving to be a hindrance? Availability of aircraft. Though we all know that no airline can be operationalised without aircraft, it is here that the RP has gone horribly wrong. If the RP felt that aircraft lessors can be bulldozed into submission through a moratorium imposed by NCLT &mdash; allow Go First to use aircraft pending the final NCLT verdict &mdash; it hasn&rsquo;t happened that way. The lessors, who had leased aircraft to the airline earlier, have not only sought deregistration of aircraft to repossess them but have also denied use of them by taking up the matter with equal vigour in the NCLT,&nbsp;the Delhi High Court&nbsp;and the Supreme Court.\n",
      " \n",
      " Any hope for an out-of-court resolution &mdash; if it was at all being looked at &mdash; was nipped in the bud when the RP decided on challenging the ruling of a&nbsp;single-member bench of the Delhi High Court, which had permitted the lessors of Go First to access and inspect the leased planes. The order was upheld by the division bench of the high court, following which Go First moved the apex court.\n",
      " \n",
      " This was preceded by the NCLT, having earlier rejected pleas of the lessors to restrain the airline from commercial flying, stating that aircraft were available for flights since the aviation regulator DGCA had not deregistered the carrier. This was a purely technical argument but was enough to provide a flicker of hope. It should have logically been apparent to the NCLT judges hearing the case that since it was just not fair to aircraft lessors, they would challenge it and make the resolution even more time-consuming.\n",
      " \n",
      " With no compromise solution in sight, one wonders if the lenders, the DGCA and the employees can be made to wait indefinitely.&nbsp;Considering that three months have passed and the airline has been unable to fly again, the lenders and the DGCA need to ponder on whether they have to remain passive observers as the RP struggles to find a solution or if they should take a proactive approach. One is not sure if the lenders have been on the same page as the RP in this legal tussle with the aircraft lessors.\n",
      " \n",
      " Pragmatic Approach Needed\n",
      " \n",
      " While the CoC has recognised the fact that valuation of an operational airline is always more than a grounded airline and thus agreed to provide interim funding to make Go First fly again, it has overlooked another critical factor &mdash; revival becomes more and more difficult, if not impossible, if the time elapsed since the suspension of operations goes beyond a point.\n",
      " \n",
      " It will therefore be in the fitness of things that the CoC and the DGCA adopt a proactive approach; consider wresting the initiative from the RP as lenders have more at stake than other stakeholders with the risk of losing&nbsp;Rs&nbsp;6,521 crore lent to the beleaguered airline. The CoC had, while intervening in the court proceedings at an earlier stage, averred that they should be treated as the ultimate decision-making authority and that aircraft lessors' rights should not receive priority over theirs.\n",
      " \n",
      " It was a valid point but what they, quite like the RP, missed out was on whether the airline can be made operational without the cooperation of aircraft lessors. The CoC thus currently has two options. One, wait indefinitely for the RP to determine the destiny. Two, wrest the initiative from the RP or guide him with active participation since developments thus far haven&rsquo;t been very assuring for revival.\n",
      " \n",
      " The CoC should no longer remain a mute bystander but play a proactive role since time is of the essence. That the CoC hasn&rsquo;t been playing an effective role was evident when it agreed to extend interim funding based on a plan submitted by the RP without questioning the availability of aircraft. It had required proper due diligence but they failed in it. Merely hoping for the airline to be airborne without everything in place is fraught with the involved banks sinking even the money they are proposing to invest for recovering the initial loans extended to the airline.\n",
      " \n",
      " The DGCA has also unfortunately played a passive role thus far. It has kept its action on applications for aircraft deregistration in abeyance by taking shelter under the NCLT&rsquo;s moratorium. Considering that revival is impossible without the aircraft, the DGCA can also play a meaningful role. It can summon the lessors and informally check the conditions on which they would be willing to make the aircraft available. This will shorten the period of resolution if indeed there is any hope for it.\n",
      " \n",
      " Time Is Of The Essence\n",
      " \n",
      " What do aircraft lessors want? It shouldn&rsquo;t be very difficult to guess if one was to think as an aircraft lessor &mdash; repossession of aircraft or payment of lease rentals. Can the CoC make that commitment? If not, why prolong the hope which wouldn&rsquo;t eventually fructify? To believe that aircraft can be deployed for commercial operations without settling the payment issues on the strength of NCLT&rsquo;s order will be nothing short of misleading oneself.\n",
      " \n",
      " Someone has therefore to rethink the strategy, which is not only pragmatic and fair to all stakeholders but also less time-consuming. In the three months that have gone by, the agony of the employees has gone completely unnoticed. Those who haven&rsquo;t found another job and continue to be on the rolls of Go First in the hope that their airline will be airborne soon haven&rsquo;t been paid their salaries since May. A holistic view thus needs to be taken to avoid a situation of somehow managing aircraft through compromises but later finding that there aren&rsquo;t adequate employees, particularly pilots left in the airline to fly the aircraft.\n",
      " \n",
      " The revival ought to have been wrapped up in a much shorter time because liabilities are only zooming with every passing day, making the prospects of revival that much more difficult, and costly.\n",

      " \n",
      " What is an MF folio?\n",
      " \n",
      " Mutual fund folio can loosely be compared to an account in a bank. One can have multiple accounts in a bank. Similarly, one can have multiple folios with a mutual fund house. Mutual funds also allow zero-balance folio. Simply put, if you sell all units of schemes held in a particular folio then it becomes a zero-balance folio. Such folios can be used again to invest in schemes of mutual fund schemes. Each mutual fund house issues a separate folio number. For subsequent investments, you are supposed to quote the same folio number if you want to keep your investment under one folio. Otherwise, a different folio number is issued.\n",

If you fail to provide these or do not choose explicitly not to appoint a nominee, then the fund folios cannot be created. Be it a paper route or an online route, while creating a new folio, these inputs are must.\n",
      " \n",
      " But in earlier days it was not the case. Many times investors initiated investments without keying in the right inputs. For example, some investors used to ask distributors to write the distributors&rsquo; mobile numbers and email ids as the contact information. Over a period of time, such lapses can adversely affect the ability to transact. For example, the one-time password (OTP) sent for login into the portal or approving transactions may not reach the investor at all if the phone or email does not belong to the investor.\n",

      " The capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has, over time, been tightening the operational aspects when it comes to investing in MFs. The mutual fund investors were asked to declare if the email and mobile numbers keyed into their folios belonged to them or their family members. If you have old folios without such details, then you need to fix them as soon as possible. Over time, fund houses and registrar and transfer agents (RTAs) got in touch with investors to set records straight in their MF investments.\n",
      " \n",
      " As investors, you should make sure that the information and nominations in your folios are up to date. If your MF folio does not have a nomination or you do not explicitly opt out of it before September 30, 2023, then you will not be allowed to redeem, switch or register a systematic transfer plan or systematic withdrawal plan from such folios from October 1, 2023.\n",

      " \n",
      " Some Do-It-Yourself investors prefer to create separate folios for each financial goal. For example, one may use a folio to fund a child&rsquo;s education and another for funding retirement. Sometimes from the point of view of operational ease, separate folios are warranted. One can have a single-holder folio and a joint-holder folio as well. Within a joint-holder folio, a maximum of three investors are allowed including the first holder. Joint holder folios can be operated by either or a survivor mandate or with a joint mandate. There is no restriction on how many folios you can have. However, to make it easy for you to track, keep the number of folios to a bare minimum, especially within fund houses.\n",

A folio held in the joint name, let&rsquo;s say A and B, cannot be consolidated with a folio held in the name of A or held in the name of B or a folio held in the name of B and A.\n",

However, if your distributor is not offering you such a facility or you have some legacy investments or you are transacting on multiple platforms, then you should check the folios and update your contact details and nominees wherever applicable, at the earliest opportunity.\n",

      " \n",
      " Nikhil Apte\n",
      " \n",
      " Property insurance plays a crucial role in protecting individuals and businesses against potential risks and losses associated with their properties. It offers coverage for various types of properties, ranging from residential homes to commercial establishments, safeguarding against perils like fire, theft, natural disasters, and more.\n",
      " \n",
      " However, when it comes to insuring properties in diverse locations such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, Dubai, and Ontario, it becomes evident that a single policy from India cannot adequately address the unique risks and regulatory frameworks associated with each region.\n",
      " \n",
      " Also read: How to file insurance claims for your damaged cars\n",
      " \n",
      " Firstly, the geographical and climatic variations between these locations contribute to differing risk profiles. Mumbai, for instance, is prone to cyclones and flooding due to its coastal location. Bengaluru, on the other hand, generally experiences milder climate conditions but is susceptible to water scarcity and occasional hailstorms.\n",
      " \n",
      " In contrast, Dubai faces extreme heat, sandstorms, and the potential risks associated with rapid urbanisation. Ontario, located in Canada, is subject to harsh winters, snowstorms, and freezing temperatures. Such variations require tailored insurance coverage to address the specific risks prevalent in each area.\n",
      " \n",
      " Unique nature of property insurance\n",
      " \n",
      " Unlike health insurance policies that often offer a floater concept, property insurance is issued for a specific property. Each property possesses its own distinct characteristics, including the area, geography, and associated risks.\n",
      " \n",
      " Therefore, it is not possible to combine multiple properties under a single property insurance policy in India. This is because the risks and requirements associated with each property differ significantly, necessitating the issuance of separate policies.\n",

      " Also read: Moneycontrol-SecureNow Health Insurance Ratings: How to choose the right health policy\n",
      " \n",
      " Limitations of geographical coverage\n",
      " \n",
      " An Indian non-life insurance company holds a licence that restricts its operations to providing property insurance coverage solely for properties situated within the geographical boundaries of India. Consequently, properties located in Dubai or Ontario cannot be insured by this Indian insurer, as they lack authorisation to issue policies for locations outside India.\n",
      " \n",
      " Each jurisdiction has its own unique legal and regulatory frameworks governing property insurance. Thus, insurance policies must adhere to the local laws and regulations of the respective regions.\n",
      " \n",
      " For instance, Mumbai and Bengaluru operate under the jurisdiction of Indian laws, while Dubai follows the regulations established by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Ontario abides by Canadian regulations. These regional variations make it impractical to have a single policy originating from India that can effectively meet the legal requirements and nuances of all these regions.\n",
      " \n",
      " Sourcing coverage from local markets\n",
      " \n",
      " To ensure adequate coverage for properties in geographies like London, Dubai or Ontario, it is necessary to source insurance from the respective local markets.\n",
      " \n",
      " Local insurance providers in these regions are equipped with the knowledge and expertise to assess the specific risks associated with properties in their areas. They possess a comprehensive understanding of local regulations, construction practices, and environmental factors that affect insurance coverage and premium calculations.\n",
      " \n",
      " Why separate policies are essential\n",
      " \n",
      " By issuing separate policies for each property, insurers can tailor coverage based on the unique risk profiles of individual properties. This allows for precise evaluation of risk factors and appropriate premium calculations. Additionally, it ensures that claims and compensation processes are streamlined, as each property is treated separately in the event of a loss or damage.\n",
      " \n",
      " Benefits of local market coverage\n",
      " \n",
      " Obtaining property insurance coverage from local markets has several advantages. Firstly, local insurers possess an in-depth understanding of the regional risks and can offer specialised coverage to mitigate these risks effectively. They also have established relationships with local service providers, facilitating prompt claim settlement and efficient restoration processes.\n",
      " \n",
      " Moreover, local insurers are well-versed in the legal and regulatory frameworks governing insurance in their respective regions. This ensures compliance with local laws and regulations, providing policyholders with added confidence and security.\n",
      " \n",
      " Property insurance plays a vital role in safeguarding our assets from unexpected events. However, it is important to recognise the limitations of property insurance policies, particularly in terms of geographical coverage. Understanding that separate policies are necessary for each property and seeking coverage from local markets for properties located outside India is crucial.\n",
      " \n",
      " By adhering to these principles, policyholders can ensure comprehensive coverage that aligns with the unique characteristics and risks associated with their properties, thereby providing them with peace of mind and financial security.\n",

      " Your university-recommended policy can come to your aid once you reach the campus, but an overseas travel policy will take care of risks such as loss of baggage or laptop and trip cancellation or flight delay that may crop up during your journey.\n",
      " \n",
      " Moneycontrol spoke to Amit Chhabra, Chief Business Officer, Travel Insurance, Policybazaar.com to understand the importance of buying these policies, nitty-gritties, choosing between university-recommended health covers and overseas student policies offered by Indian insurers.\n",
      " \n",
      " Here are some key pointers that emerged out of the discussion:\n",
      " \n",
      " - August and September typically see a lot of students flying out, as September semester typically sees a large intake, particularly in the US.\n",
      " \n",
      " - As against business or leisure travel, which offer coverage for a maximum of 180 days, an overseas student travel policy offers longer-term insurance.\n",
      " \n",
      " - This is important because unlike business or leisure travellers, students have to stay in their destination countries for one to five years, depending on the courses they have signed up for.\n",
      " \n",
      " - Another big difference is that regular travel policies are primarily meant to cover emergency situations (for instance, a stroke that needs immediate medical attention). Student travel insurance policies are more comprehensive.\n",
      " \n",
      " - They will not only pay for medical expenses incurred if you, say, contract a viral infection or have to undergo dental treatment but also for loss of laptop and study interruptions due to emergency at home or violence in the city where your university is located, for instance.\n",
      " \n",
      " - It is like your long-term companion during your stay abroad &ndash; a health insurance policy with additional benefits such as sponsor protection, compassionate visit, study interruption, coverage for legal expenses if the need arises and so on.\n",
      " \n",
      " - You can buy an international student insurance policy online even a couple of days before you fly out, but ideally, you should do it at least a week prior.\n",
      " \n",
      " Also read:&nbsp;Studying abroad? Be aware of these 5 additional costs linked to your education\n",
      " \n",
      " - It is a serious subject and premiums are not cheap, so you ought to do a&nbsp; thorough comparison before you choose a policy.\n",
      " \n",
      " - A student travelling to Europe and choosing a $500,000-cover will have to pay a premium of Rs 23,000 for two years, while the premium for a sum insured of $100,000 would be Rs 14,000.\n",
      " \n",
      " - The difference in premiums is not exorbitant. So, ideally, you should look to buy policies with maximum sum insured, budget permitting.\n",
      " \n",
      " - Understand the sub-limits and deductibles. For instance, even if you buy a $500,000-policy, the coverage for baggage loss could be limited to $500 or $1000, for instance.\n",
      " \n",
      " - Likewise, there could be deductibles. For instance, if the dental treatment cover is $500, you might have to shell out $50 from your pocket before the insurance company chips in with the balance.\n",
      " \n",
      " - Universities abroad encourage students to buy health insurance from local insurers they might have tied up with. However, they typically do not make it mandatory to buy covers from such partnered insurers\n",
      " \n",
      " - Buying overseas student travel policies offered by Indian insurers is a better idea for two reasons. One, they are rupee-denominated and not foreign-currency denominated unlike university-recommended covers and hence, cheaper. Some sample (university-recommended plans) that we have seen are 2-3 times costlier than Indian travel policies.\n",
      " \n",
      " - Secondly, university-recommended plans are essentially health insurance policies that cover illness and accidents.\n",
      " \n",
      " - Overseas student travel policies, on the other hand, offer additional covers such as baggage loss, passport loss, trip cancellation, flight delay, personal liability and study interruption.\n",

      " Article 1 - Headline: Does money win the war &mdash; Inferences from the Russian push in defence expenditure\n",
      " \n",
      " As the Russia-Ukraine war continues unabated, both countries are exploring ways and means to gain an upper hand. The latest is the so-called quantum jump in Russia&rsquo;s defence expenditure (defex). According to a recent&nbsp;Reuters report, Russia has nearly doubled its defex target&nbsp;to more than $102 billion in the current year. The announcement is not surprising since Russia is on a spending spree to finance its war activities and has apparently spent the allocated budget by June this year. However, it is debatable if a quantum jump alone would enable Russia to gain&nbsp;a&nbsp;decisive advantage over Ukraine.\n",
      " \n",
      " War-led Spending\n",
      " \n",
      " According to the&nbsp;2023 SIPRI Factsheet&nbsp;on Trends in Military Expenditure, Russia emerged as the third largest spender (from fifth in 2021) after the US and China, spending more than $86 billion and accounting for 4.1 percent of its GDP in 2022.&nbsp;SIPRI data, therefore, is at variance with Reuter&rsquo;s claim, since there is an increase of only 20 percent over last year&rsquo;s figures. Hitherto, Russia is an autocratic, militarised state with overgrown military establishments, perpetual warfare, high-level military mobilisation and a consequential larger share for the military in resource allocation. For example, in 2022, only seven countries allocated more defex as a proportion of GDP than Russia. Further, Russia continues to monetise some portions of oil exports and, therefore, would most likely sustain the revenue model for its war activities and allocate even higher portions of GDP to&nbsp;defence&nbsp;in future.\n",
      " \n",
      " However, Ukraine has also pushed up its defex. It moved from the 36th position in 2021 to the 11th in 2022, spending $44 billion. This was a 640 percent increase over its 2021 defex figures. A balance of fortunes would possibly emerge only if there is a huge asymmetry between the two countries. That is not happening since Ukraine was also able to raise a significant amount through military assistance and loans from NATO countries.&nbsp;The US, for example, has committed more than $40 billion in security assistance&nbsp;alone since February 2022. Another $35 billion stands committed for humanitarian and financial aid. A matching contribution has also been committed by the European Union institutions and non-US NATO members. Therefore, Russian defex increases are meaningless.\n",
      " \n",
      " Money Just One Factor\n",
      " \n",
      " Hitherto, money is only one of the numerous factors in warfare. For example, America&rsquo;s defence budget is 39 percent of the global defence expenditure and is three times more than China, the next in the pecking order. Yet, America has not been able to win any war in recent times after the 1991 Gulf War success. Saudi Arabia is the fifth-largest military spender and is either the largest or second-largest importer of weapons in the international arms market. Yet, Saudi Arabia has failed to metamorphose itself into a recognised military power in the Gulf and West Asia region. It emerges, therefore, that there are significant non-monetary factors that decide the fate of contemporary wars.\n",
      " \n",
      " Unfortunately, Russia has many such problems that undermine the budgetary increases. First, Russia does not have a conducive military culture for carrying out successful war activities. Years of combat experience notwithstanding, Russian soldiers are fatigued. While Russia has an advanced military-industrial complex (MIC) and has been a lead arms supplier, the personnel side of military modernisation remains in shambles. Soldiers are not getting paid in time and efforts to push up military reforms were never taken seriously. The military leadership is uninspiring, best evident in the&nbsp;open revolt by a private army&nbsp;against them some time ago.\n",
      " \n",
      " Hurt By Sanctions\n",
      " \n",
      " Second, Russia&rsquo;s supply chain economy for delivering quantitative and qualitative military hardware is increasingly coming under challenge. From being an arms exporter, Russia is now desperate to import vital spare parts for its arsenals. Its domestic MIC is not able to produce many of those items despite liberal budgetary support and manpower training in weapons production. Part of the reason is the tightening of global economic sanctions on Russia and its extermination from all international arms markets.\n",
      " \n",
      " Third, despite being an established military power, Russia is not able to come out with disruptive military innovations or technologies to gain a significant advantage over Ukraine. Its Air Force failed to make a decisive dent into Ukraine&rsquo;s air space. The missile forces too have not made any significant damage after early impact. Russia, it seems, is a victim of overconfidence and poor strategic instincts. On the contrary, Ukraine has won back sizeable portions of territory from the Russian military. In recent times, it has taken the war to Russian territory, hitting portions of Moscow and sea ports in&nbsp;drone attacks from far-off distances.\n",
      " \n",
      " Contemporary wars are protracted wars. Even great powers are not able to clinch an outright victory. In uncertain war atmospherics, overt emphasis on defence spending is more about politics and marketing than an effective tool in war economy management. Therefore, it is debatable if defex increases alone will induce favourable military fortunes for Russia. At best, it would perpetuate Russia&rsquo;s military economy without ensuring a decisive outcome in the ongoing war against Ukraine.\n",

      " Low-Key Rollout\n",
      " The White House announced the order after US markets closed Wednesday, but reaction was expected to be muted. Major US investors had anticipated it for some time, and venture-capital firms had already been scaling back their bets on Chinese startups for well over a year.\n",
      " \n",
      " A relatively low-key rollout on Wednesday showcased how cautious the White House is about ratcheting up tensions with China. Instead of announcing it in the presence of media and giving public remarks on the matter &mdash; as is often the case for executive orders &mdash; Biden opted to sign it while out of town and without cameras.

The two leaders could meet in November when Biden hosts the APEC summit in San Francisco, but neither side has confirmed the plans.\n",

      "URL: https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/    Article 1 - Headline: RBI Policy: FY24 inflation now seen 30 bps higher at 5.4%, big hike in Q2 forecast    The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on August 10 made an upward revision to its inflation forecast for 2023-24, raising it by 30 basis points to 5.4 percent.    In his address on the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) latest decision to leave the key policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent for the third time in a row, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the risks to the inflation forecasts were \"evenly balanced\".    Driving the full-year inflation forecast hike was that for the second quarter, which is now seen at 6.2 percent - a full hundred basis points higher than previously hoped - due to a sharp increase in vegetable prices.    Also Read: FinMin says rise in food inflation warrants guarded approach by govt, RBI    \"The month of July has witnessed accentuation of food inflation, primarily on account of vegetables. The spike in tomato prices and further increase in prices of cereals and pulses have contributed to this. Consequently, a substantial increase in headline inflation would occur in the near-term,\" Das said in his address announcing the MPC's decision.    The quarterly break-up of the inflation forecast is as follows:    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; July-September 2023 Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation forecast raised to 6.2 percent from 5.2 percent    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; October-December 2023 CPI inflation forecast raised to 5.7 percent from 5.4 percent    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; January-March 2024 CPI inflation forecast retained at 5.2 percent    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; April-June 2024 CPI inflation forecast pegged at 5.2 percent     Source: Reserve Bank of India    As is visible in the forecasts, the huge jump in inflation in July-September is expected to recede quickly, with the RBI governor saying that past trends suggested vegetable prices may see a \"significant correction\" after a few months.    \"Given the likely short-term nature of these shocks, monetary policy can look through high inflation prints caused by such shocks for some time,\" Das added.    CPI inflation is set to shoot up in July - data for which will be released on August 14 - and cross the upper bound of the Indian central bank's 2-6 percent tolerance range for the first time in five months.    Article 2 - Headline: Three factors that prevent India and China from getting close    Both India and China lie at the heart of the geopolitical churn in the Indo-Pacific, with their bilateral relationship holding significant implications for the future of the world order. While India is pursuing a policy of multi-alignment, it increasingly seems to be caught between two emerging power centres. On one side is a rising China, which is seeking to actively reshape the international order to facilitate its rise to the centre-stage of world affairs; on the other is the US, which is working to boost domestic strength, revitalise old alliances and fashion new partnerships in order to sustain its preeminence.    So what does this mean for the relationship between India and China? After all, China is not only India's largest neighbour but a key trading partner. At the same time, the two sides increasingly appear to be moving towards greater friction and hostility along the disputed boundary. Will the intensified tensions result in more conflict, even if of just low-intensity variety? Or is there a possibility for some sort of new peaceful equilibrium, perhaps even friendship, between the two?    Intersecting Zones Of Influence    To my mind, three structural factors make it difficult for India and China to get close.    First, as both have risen over the past three decades, their interests have not only expanded but also now increasingly intersect across each other's traditional zones of influence. Beijing's intensified engagement in the Indian subcontinent and Delhi's more public expression of concern around issues of the South China Sea are examples of this.    What's more, both sides have greater capabilities today and have demonstrated increased political willingness to pursue those interests. An example of this is the increased military capacity along the disputed border leading to the two forces brushing up against each other more frequently.    Growing Power And Asymmetry    Secondly, as their power has grown so has the asymmetry between the two. This differential has resulted in Beijing being more risk-tolerant and resorting to greater coercion to confine India within the subcontinent.    China's common refrain that India should put the boundary issue in its \"proper place in bilateral relations\" and accept the coercively-altered status quo in Eastern Ladakh is an example of its view that India should acknowledge the power differential and act accordingly.    Such an accession will not only be politically damaging for any Indian establishment but also strategically imprudent. In response, India has sought to resist while talking, de-risk in certain domains and counterbalance with actors like the US and Australia.    US-India Proximity    This feeds into the third structural factor, i.e., the deepening competition between China and the US. China is quite anxious and vocal about its displeasure with India's unprecedented proximity with the US.    A Delhi closely aligned with Washington presents a formidable hurdle for Beijing's global ambitions. But Chinese scholars also acknowledge that the Washington-Delhi embrace is not necessarily of an alliance variety; there exist limitations, grievances, complications and divergences of interests.    Consequently, Beijing repeatedly urges Delhi to view bilateral relations in the context of the once-in-a-century changes taking place in the world and think of bilateral cooperation from the perspective of their respective national rejuvenation. Yet, there is precious little that China has done to demonstrate appreciation for India's interests and aspirations.    Its policy has predominantly relied on coercion rather than accommodation. This has further damaged the already low levels of trust between the elites and populations on both sides.    Sliding Public Opinion    For instance, the last formal meeting between Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping was in October 2019. The informal chat they had in Bali last year didn't move the needle at all. Public opinion, meanwhile, has also sunk. Indians have historically held a rather negative view of China, though there was a brief period of positivity around China's development achievements around 2006-2008.    This sentiment has since faded, with recent Pew polling data showing that negative opinions about China in India rose from 46 percent in 2019 to 67 percent in 2023. Other surveys also reflect this trend, which has sharpened since the events of 2020.    Likewise in China, India is increasingly being viewed from a threat-prism. For instance, a recent poll by Tsinghua University found that merely 8 percent of Chinese people had a favourable opinion of India.    Politics Trumps Economics    Despite all the above, it is evident that trade between India and China is continuing to expand. For many, this is a contradiction. Such views, however, miss the point that increasingly both sides are approaching trade from a strategic prism.    In this context, India has been open to trade and investment expansion merely to the extent that there may be few suitable alternatives and doing so serves the requirement of intermediate and capital goods for its electronics and manufacturing sectors. This is critical for India's rise as a major power.    At the same time, Delhi has sought to de-risk in emerging technologies, core telecom systems and what are seen as strategic domains. This approach needs far greater refinement and precision targeting.    In essence, even if the bilateral trade figure continues to expand, the relationship between India and China will remain difficult and volatile, for in today's era, politics trumps economics.

Article 3 - Headline: Does money win the war - Inferences from the Russian push in defence expenditure    As the Russia-Ukraine war continues unabated, both countries are exploring ways and means to gain an upper hand. The latest is the so-called quantum jump in Russia's defence expenditure (defex). According to a recent Reuters report, Russia has nearly doubled its defex target to more than $102 billion in the current year. The announcement is not surprising since Russia is on a spending spree to finance its war activities and has apparently spent the allocated budget by June this year. However, it is debatable if a quantum jump alone would enable Russia to gain a decisive advantage over Ukraine.    War-led Spending    According to the 2023 SIPRI Factsheet on Trends in Military Expenditure, Russia emerged as the third largest spender (from fifth in 2021) after the US and China, spending more than $86 billion and accounting for 4.1 percent of its GDP in 2022. SIPRI data, therefore, is at variance with Reuter's claim, since there is an increase of only 20 percent over last year's figures. Hitherto, Russia is an autocratic, militarised state with overgrown military establishments, perpetual warfare, high-level military mobilisation and a consequential larger share for the military in resource allocation. For example, in 2022, only seven countries allocated more defex as a proportion of GDP than Russia. Further, Russia continues to monetise some portions of oil exports and, therefore, would most likely sustain the revenue model for its war activities and allocate even higher portions of GDP to defence in future.    However, Ukraine has also pushed up its defex. It moved from the 36th position in 2021 to the 11th in 2022, spending $44 billion. This was a 640 percent increase over its 2021 defex figures. A balance of fortunes would possibly emerge only if there is a huge asymmetry between the two countries. That is not happening since Ukraine was also able to raise a significant amount through military assistance and loans from NATO countries. The US, for example, has committed more than $40 billion in security assistance alone since February 2022. Another $35 billion stands committed for humanitarian and financial aid. A matching contribution has also been committed by the European Union institutions and non-US NATO members. Therefore, Russian defex increases are meaningless.    Money Just One Factor    Hitherto, money is only one of the numerous factors in warfare. For example, America's defence budget is 39 percent of the global defence expenditure and is three times more than China, the next in the pecking order. Yet, America has not been able to win any war in recent times after the 1991 Gulf War success. Saudi Arabia is the fifth-largest military spender and is either the largest or second-largest importer of weapons in the international arms market. Yet, Saudi Arabia has failed to metamorphose itself into a recognised military power in the Gulf and West Asia region. It emerges, therefore, that there are significant non-monetary factors that decide the fate of contemporary wars.    Unfortunately, Russia has many such problems that undermine the budgetary increases. First, Russia does not have a conducive military culture for carrying out successful war activities. Years of combat experience notwithstanding, Russian soldiers are fatigued. While Russia has an advanced military-industrial complex (MIC) and has been a lead arms supplier, the personnel side of military modernisation remains in shambles. Soldiers are not getting paid in time and efforts to push up military reforms were never taken seriously. The military leadership is uninspiring, best evident in the open revolt by a private army against them some time ago.    Hurt By Sanctions    Second, Russia's supply chain economy for delivering quantitative and qualitative military hardware is increasingly coming under challenge. From being an arms exporter, Russia is now desperate to import vital spare parts for its arsenals. Its domestic MIC is not able to produce many of those items despite liberal budgetary support and manpower training in weapons production. Part of the reason is the tightening of global economic sanctions on Russia and its extermination from all international arms markets.    Third, despite being an established military power, Russia is not able to come out with disruptive military innovations or technologies to gain a significant advantage over Ukraine. Its Air Force failed to make a decisive dent into Ukraine's air space. The missile forces too have not made any significant damage after early impact. Russia, it seems, is a victim of overconfidence and poor strategic instincts. On the contrary, Ukraine has won back sizeable portions of territory from the Russian military. In recent times, it has taken the war to Russian territory, hitting portions of Moscow and sea ports in drone attacks from far-off distances.    Contemporary wars are protracted wars. Even great powers are not able to clinch an outright victory. In uncertain war atmospherics, overt emphasis on defence spending is more about politics and marketing than an effective tool in war economy management. Therefore, it is debatable if defex increases alone will induce favourable military fortunes for Russia. At best, it would perpetuate Russia's military economy without ensuring a decisive outcome in the ongoing war against Ukraine.    Bhartendu Kumar Singh is in the Indian Defence Accounts Service.

Article 4 - Headline: Delay in Go First's revival plan calls for a change in strategy    It was on May 10, 2023, exactly three months ago, that the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted the voluntary insolvency petition of Go First thus triggering a moratorium on assets and liabilities. In its order, it also barred the company from retrenching employees so that the airline was maintained as a going concern to make the revival possible.    Even though the Resolution Professional (RP) has been at work with the active support of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the airline continues to remain grounded. The RP's optimism on revival, even as most industry observers found it to be misplaced, was reflected in the public notice issued to invite expressions of interest from potential buyers with August 9, 2023 as the deadline. Developments such as the CoC agreeing to provide interim funding of  Rs 425 crore and the DGCA according approval to the revival plan, with riders, after scaling down the number of aircraft that were likely available and could be deployed, lent some hope. This was all during the month of July.    Two developments of this week - the refusal of the Supreme Court of India to overrule or interfere in the proceedings on the petition of aircraft lessors in the Delhi High Court and the extension of the deadline for submission of expression of interest by a month to September 8, 2023 are enough indications that revival of Go First is not on the horizon any time soon.    Aircraft Hold The Key    What is it that is proving to be a hindrance? Availability of aircraft. Though we all know that no airline can be operationalised without aircraft, it is here that the RP has gone horribly wrong. If the RP felt that aircraft lessors can be bulldozed into submission through a moratorium imposed by NCLT - allow Go First to use aircraft pending the final NCLT verdict - it hasn't happened that way. The lessors, who had leased aircraft to the airline earlier, have not only sought deregistration of aircraft to repossess them but have also denied use of them by taking up the matter with equal vigour in the NCLT, the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court.    Any hope for an out-of-court resolution - if it was at all being looked at - was nipped in the bud when the RP decided on challenging the ruling of a single-member bench of the Delhi High Court, which had permitted the lessors of Go First to access and inspect the leased planes. The order was upheld by the division bench of the high court, following which Go First moved the apex court.    This was preceded by the NCLT, having earlier rejected pleas of the lessors to restrain the airline from commercial flying, stating that aircraft were available for flights since the aviation regulator DGCA had not deregistered the carrier. This was a purely technical argument but was enough to provide a flicker of hope. It should have logically been apparent to the NCLT judges hearing the case that since it was just not fair to aircraft lessors, they would challenge it and make the resolution even more time-consuming.    With no compromise solution in sight, one wonders if the lenders, the DGCA and the employees can be made to wait indefinitely. Considering that three months have passed and the airline has been unable to fly again, the lenders and the DGCA need to ponder on whether they have to remain passive observers as the RP struggles to find a solution or if they should take a proactive approach. One is not sure if the lenders have been on the same page as the RP in this legal tussle with the aircraft lessors.    Pragmatic Approach Needed    While the CoC has recognised the fact that valuation of an operational airline is always more than a grounded airline and thus agreed to provide interim funding to make Go First fly again, it has overlooked another critical factor - revival becomes more and more difficult, if not impossible, if the time elapsed since the suspension of operations goes beyond a point.    It will therefore be in the fitness of things that the CoC and the DGCA adopt a proactive approach; consider wresting the initiative from the RP as lenders have more at stake than other stakeholders with the risk of losing Rs 6,521 crore lent to the beleaguered airline. The CoC had, while intervening in the court proceedings at an earlier stage, averred that they should be treated as the ultimate decision-making authority and that aircraft lessors' rights should not receive priority over theirs.    It was a valid point but what they, quite like the RP, missed out was on whether the airline can be made operational without the cooperation of aircraft lessors. The CoC thus currently has two options. One, wait indefinitely for the RP to determine the destiny. Two, wrest the initiative from the RP or guide him with active participation since developments thus far haven't been very assuring for revival.    The CoC should no longer remain a mute bystander but play a proactive role since time is of the essence. That the CoC hasn't been playing an effective role was evident when it agreed to extend interim funding based on a plan submitted by the RP without questioning the availability of aircraft. It had required proper due diligence but they failed in it. Merely hoping for the airline to be airborne without everything in place is fraught with the involved banks sinking even the money they are proposing to invest for recovering the initial loans extended to the airline.    The DGCA has also unfortunately played a passive role thus far. It has kept its action on applications for aircraft deregistration in abeyance by taking shelter under the NCLT's moratorium. Considering that revival is impossible without the aircraft, the DGCA can also play a meaningful role. It can summon the lessors and informally check the conditions on which they would be willing to make the aircraft available. This will shorten the period of resolution if indeed there is any hope for it.    Time Is Of The Essence    What do aircraft lessors want? It shouldn't be very difficult to guess if one was to think as an aircraft lessor - repossession of aircraft or payment of lease rentals. Can the CoC make that commitment? If not, why prolong the hope which wouldn't eventually fructify? To believe that aircraft can be deployed for commercial operations without settling the payment issues on the strength of NCLT's order will be nothing short of misleading oneself.    Someone has therefore to rethink the strategy, which is not only pragmatic and fair to all stakeholders but also less time-consuming. In the three months that have gone by, the agony of the employees has gone completely unnoticed. Those who haven't found another job and continue to be on the rolls of Go First in the hope that their airline will be airborne soon haven't been paid their salaries since May. A holistic view thus needs to be taken to avoid a situation of somehow managing aircraft through compromises but later finding that there aren't adequate employees, particularly pilots left in the airline to fly the aircraft.    The revival ought to have been wrapped up in a much shorter time because liabilities are only zooming with every passing day, making the prospects of revival that much more difficult, and costly.

The consortium of Japanese firms may reach an agreement with Think Gas's backer I Squared Capital as soon as September, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is confidential. Bloomberg News reported in March that the private equity firm was working with an adviser on a potential sale of as much as 30% of Think Gas.    Though deliberations are advanced, I Squared could still decide against proceeding with the deal, the people said. Representatives for I Squared Capital, Osaka Gas and Sumitomo declined to comment, while Think Gas didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.    Established by I Squared in 2018, Think Gas operates across 13 districts in India and supplies natural gas to the domestic, commercial, industrial and automotive sectors, according to its website. In 2021, the infrastructure focused I Squared invested about $200 million in Singapore-based AG&amp;amp;P City Gas, another city gas distributor in India that has 12 concessions in the country.    Article 2 - Headline: WeWork's bankruptcy warning to not impact India unit    WeWork's warning of a bankruptcy risk would not have an impact on its India unit, regional CEO Karan Virwani said on Wednesday.    New York-based WeWork, which was valued at $47 billion in 2019, on Tuesday raised \"substantial\" doubt around the continuance of its operations and warned of a possible bankruptcy.    WeWork India, which is backed and owned in majority by Indian real estate firm Embassy Group, said it was focused on growth with sustained profitability and the fundamentals of its business remain strong.    \"We ended FY 2022-23 with revenue of 14 billion Indian Rupees ($168.99 million), and 2.5 billion Indian Rupees ($30.18 million) in earnings,\" India CEO Virwani said.

The real estate investment manager said its new CapitaLand India Growth Fund 2 would have a target fund size of S$525 million and invest in Grade A business parks in prime locations across gateway cities in India.    Additionally, the company said it had secured a S$263 million funding from a global institution for a 50% stake in the fund's first closing.    CapitaLand's total funds under management stood at S$89 billion as of March 31, with a target to reach S$100 billion by fiscal year 2024.    URL: https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds/    Article 1 - Headline: Equity fund inflows dip 12 % in July, SIPs top Rs 15,000 crore for first time    Open-ended equity mutual funds recorded a 12 percent decline in net inflow to Rs 7,626 crore in July as large-cap funds continued to grapple with outflows, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) released on August 9, showed.    Despite this, Indian investors remained disciplined in their investment approach with inflows into Systematic Investments Plans (SIPs) topping the Rs 15,000 crore for the first time ever, to touch Rs 15,245 crore during July against Rs 14,735 crore in June.    Despite the marginal fall in equity fund investments, net inflows remained in the positive territory for the 29th month in a row in July amid a bull run in the equity markets. In July, the BSE benchmark Sensex scaled 2.80 percent, while NSE Nifty 50 climbed 2.94 percent.    N. S. Venkatesh, Chief Executive, AMFI, said, \"The surge in retail investors' interest in mutual funds has translated into impressive inflows across scheme categories. The star performer this month has been SIP with an impressive 33.06 lakh new accounts registered and a record Rs 15,245 crores of monthly contribution. Moreover, the industry's assets under management (AUM) have grown by 25 percent on a yearly basis, underscoring mutual funds' significance in financialization of savings.\"    Also read | Retail investors prefer index funds over ETF while going passive: Motilal Oswal AMC Survey    Thanks to the surge in debt-fund-bound investments, open-ended mutual funds saw net inflows of Rs 82,467 crore, a 63-fold spike over net inflows of Rs 1,296 crore in June.        The overall assets under management (AUM) of open-ended mutual funds increased 4.50 percent to Rs 46.11 trillion in July from Rs 44,12 trillion in the previous month.    Bullish on small-caps    The net inflows into equity mutual funds were also driven by five new fund offers (NFOs), which cumulatively collected net assets worth Rs 3,011 crore during July.    \"The drop in net inflow in July from June could be attributed to some investors booking a profit with markets trading near all-time highs. Some investors would have also chosen to stay on the sidelines and wait for some rationalization to set in before they invest,\" said Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director - Manager Research, Morningstar India.    Also read | How depository participants, banks harass legal heirs and beneficiaries looking to transmit assets    Notably, the sharp rally in the mid-cap and small-cap segments has caught investor fancy. The segments saw net inflows of Rs 4,171 crore and Rs 1,623 crore, respectively during the month.    Indian investors have been investing in both the mid-cap and small-cap categories for a couple of years. The last time these funds suffered net outflows was in February 2021 and September 2021, respectively.    On the other hand, large cap-oriented categories witnessed net outflows to the tune of Rs 1,880 crore.        \"Large cap segment has delivered good performance in recent times providing investors a good profit-booking opportunity. Investors would have also chosen to prefer currently performing mid and small-cap funds over large-cap funds,\" said Srivastava.    Debt makes a strong comeback    After witnessing a net outflow of Rs 14,135 crore in June, (the end of the quarter), debt-oriented schemes received a robust net inflow of Rs 61,400 crore in July.

Srivastava added, \"Given the current interest rate scenario and uncertainty over the direction of interest rates in the country, it appears that many investors chose to stay cautious and continue to invest in categories with one year or less maturity profile, since they carry relatively lesser interest rate risk.\"    Gold funds shine    Domestic gold exchange-traded funds saw net inflows of Rs 456 crore in July. On a year-to-date basis, inflows into the category stand at Rs 453.55 crore. Flows had been subdued in recent months as prices had run above the key Rs 60,000 mark, making investors wait on the sidelines.

Article 2 - Headline: Retail investors prefer index funds over ETF while going passive: Motilal Oswal AMC Survey    As the number of takers for passive investing increases in the Indian mutual fund industry, the segment is witnessing some interesting trends. Though exchange-traded funds (ETF) emerged as preferred vehicles for passive investing in the USA, Indian investors are rather comfortable investing through index funds than ETFs.    According to a survey done by Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company (MOAMC), 87 percent of the respondents invest through index funds, while 42 percent of the respondents invest through ETFs.    MOAMC conducted the survey online during February-May 2023 and involved more than 2,000 investors across fund houses spread across the country. Around 56percent of the respondents were in the age group of 18-35 years, whereas 54 percent live in metro cities. Sixty-one percent of the respondents reported their annual income to be less than Rs 10 lakh.    Also read: How Recurring Deposits are a smart option without risking the capital    Around 61 percent of the respondents said that they invested in at least one passive fund. Low cost, simplicity and market returns were cited as reasons for choosing passive products. Over half of the respondents (53 percent) said they increased their allocation to passive funds in the last 12 months.    In India, there is no specific preferential tax treatment for investing in units of ETFs over units of mutual funds (including index funds).    Many investors do not have demat accounts and while transacting in units of ETF, the investors may suffer from poor liquidity as well as high impact cost. Index funds do not suffer from these issues and also allow systematic investment plans (SIP) for investors, who want to invest in a staggered manner.    In March 2023, monthly SIP inflows crossed the Rs 14,000 crore mark for the first time, staying above the Rs 10,000 crore mark for 19 months in a row. In June 2023, the contribution of SIP to inflows stood at Rs 14,734 crore, according to AMFI data.

Pratik Oswal, Head of Passive Funds, MOAMC said, \"Passive funds are widely popular in the US and have over 50 percent market share. We have started seeing similar trends in India over the last few years as well. With a market share of around 17 percent, we believe that there is ample runway for passive funds ahead. This survey provides insights into how investors think about passive funds. It also helps shed some light on the thought process behind investment decisions of Indian investors.\"    The mutual fund industry has seen an increased demand for passive funds over the last five years. The assets under management (AUM) of all passive funds put together stood at Rs 7 lakh crore as on March 31, 2023, compared to Rs 83,000 crore five years ago, registering a compounded annual growth rate of 54 percent.

Flows breakdown    As per the report, net flows into equity funds have been positive over the past nine quarters even as the momentum has been dropping since the last few quarters.

Equity funds form about 40 percent of the total open-ended fund universe.    Weightwise, both the largecap and flexicap categories continued to lead the AUM split with approximately 15 percent and 16 percent, respectively, followed by midcap with 13 percent.    On the other hand, net flows in fixed-income funds have been quite disappointing in the last few quarters. But the first quarter of FY24 saw net inflows of Rs 1.39 lakh crore, the second-highest quarterly inflows for the asset class.

Only four out of 16 fixed-income categories witnessed net outflows in the quarter ended June 2023. The liquid fund category (Rs 79,908 crore) and money market fund category (Rs 29,519 crore) managed to garner the lion's share when it came to net flows during the quarter.    M-cap trend    The smallcap category saw net inflows of Rs 10,937 crore in the first quarter, the highest-ever quarterly inflows for the category. This was also the ninth consecutive quarter in which the category witnessed net inflows. The smallcap category witnessed the highest net inflows for the open-end equity asset class during the quarter.    The AUM for the smallcap equity category hit its peak of Rs 1.68 lakh in the quarter ended June.    \"Strong consistent net flows and favourable market conditions propped up the assets under management for the smallcap category to reach new heights,\" Morningstar India said in the report.

Next, the midcap category saw net inflows for the 10th consecutive quarter, wherein it managed to garner inflows of Rs 4,735 crore. Interestingly, during the quarter, the midcap category received the second-highest net inflows in the open-end equity asset class, only behind the smallcap category.    New kids on the block    Cumulatively, about 40 index funds were launched in the first half of calendar year 2023; of these, there were 31 fixed-income index funds and nine equity-based index funds.    In the quarter ended March 2023, passive index funds/target maturity funds garnered Rs 26,269 crore. The spike in flows in this segment could be attributed to the change in tax laws for the fixed-income mutual funds from fiscal year 2023-24, which takes away the indexation benefit offered to investors.

Investors, therefore, largely chose to invest in these funds to avail the benefit of indexation before the end of the financial year.    With the change in the fiscal year from April, the amount of fixed-income index funds in the June quarter was muted.    In terms of fund houses, SBI Mutual Fund launched two open-end funds during the first half of 2023, namely SBI S&amp;amp;P BSE Sensex Index and SBI Dividend Yield Fund; the cumulative AUM of these two funds stands at Rs 4,583 crore, which is the highest among the launched funds.    HDFC, on the other hand, launched 13 funds, and the cumulative AUM of these funds stood at Rs 3,218 crore.    The overall open-ended mutual fund industry was well-diversified, and weightage-wise equity funds comprised around 39 percent of the total industry AUM, followed by fixed-income funds with 31 percent. The allocation/hybrid, solution, and other categories have approximately 12 percent, 1 percent, and 18 percent weightage, respectively.    Article 4 - Headline: Mutual Fund Folio decoded: How to streamline and manage your investments effectively    As simple as it is to invest in mutual funds (MF) these days, keeping track of your portfolio can become quite a task if you have too many investments and too many MF folios. But this can be avoided if you just know how to manage your MF folios.    What is an MF folio?    Mutual fund folio can loosely be compared to an account in a bank. One can have multiple accounts in a bank. Similarly, one can have multiple folios with a mutual fund house. Mutual funds also allow zero-balance folio. Simply put, if you sell all units of schemes held in a particular folio then it becomes a zero-balance folio. Such folios can be used again to invest in schemes of mutual fund schemes. Each mutual fund house issues a separate folio number. For subsequent investments, you are supposed to quote the same folio number if you want to keep your investment under one folio. Otherwise, a different folio number is issued.  ALSO READ: FD rates for Senior Citizens: Banks that offer up to 9.1% interest on 3-year deposits    Nowadays, while creating new mutual fund folios, the fund house asks for KYC (know-your-client) details, contact details and nominations before allowing investments. If you fail to provide these or do not choose explicitly not to appoint a nominee, then the fund folios cannot be created. Be it a paper route or an online route, while creating a new folio, these inputs are must.    But in earlier days it was not the case. Many times investors initiated investments without keying in the right inputs. For example, some investors used to ask distributors to write the distributors' mobile numbers and email ids as the contact information. Over a period of time, such lapses can adversely affect the ability to transact. For example, the one-time password (OTP) sent for login into the portal or approving transactions may not reach the investor at all if the phone or email does not belong to the investor.    ALSO READ: Why a separate healthcare fund is a must for those living with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's diseases    Fixing the lapses    The capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has, over time, been tightening the operational aspects when it comes to investing in MFs. The mutual fund investors were asked to declare if the email and mobile numbers keyed into their folios belonged to them or their family members. If you have old folios without such details, then you need to fix them as soon as possible. Over time, fund houses and registrar and transfer agents (RTAs) got in touch with investors to set records straight in their MF investments.    As investors, you should make sure that the information and nominations in your folios are up to date. If your MF folio does not have a nomination or you do not explicitly opt out of it before September 30, 2023, then you will not be allowed to redeem, switch or register a systematic transfer plan or systematic withdrawal plan from such folios from October 1, 2023.    Managing folios    Some Do-It-Yourself investors prefer to create separate folios for each financial goal. For example, one may use a folio to fund a child's education and another for funding retirement. Sometimes from the point of view of operational ease, separate folios are warranted. One can have a single-holder folio and a joint-holder folio as well. Within a joint-holder folio, a maximum of three investors are allowed including the first holder. Joint holder folios can be operated by either or a survivor mandate or with a joint mandate. There is no restriction on how many folios you can have. However, to make it easy for you to track, keep the number of folios to a bare minimum, especially within fund houses.    Rupesh Bhansali, head-mutual fund, GEPL Capital, says, \"Consolidated account statement helps the investor with a list of all mutual funds investments. You can also sell trivial holdings in your MF portfolio and invest the proceeds in schemes that have meaningful weights in your portfolio.\"    While consolidating the folios the holding patterns need to match. For example, only those folios can be consolidated where the unitholder is a single holder. If the folio is in the joint names, then it can be consolidated only with those folios held in the joint names in the same order. A folio held in the joint name, let's say A and B, cannot be consolidated with a folio held in the name of A or held in the name of B or a folio held in the name of B and A.    ALSO READ: Recurring deposits (RDs) offer an alternative to equity SIPs for risk-averse investors    Viral Bhatt, Founder, Money Mantra, a Mumbai-based financial planning firm, says, \"Mutual fund folios at AMC level can be consolidated by writing to the fund house or registrar and transfer agent (RTA). Single folio at the AMC level helps you to track your investment better and the AMC or RTA to service you better. Since you get a single view of your investments, you can make better investment decisions.\"    Demat accounts    Demat accounts act as folios when the units are held in demat accounts. Many online platforms hold units in demat accounts to curb the hassle arising out of multiple folios. Those online platforms that do not use demat accounts to hold units of mutual funds show existing folio details to the investor when she opts to invest in a scheme of a mutual fund where she is already holding an investment. However, if your distributor is not offering you such a facility or you have some legacy investments or you are transacting on multiple platforms, then you should check the folios and update your contact details and nominees wherever applicable, at the earliest opportunity.

It offers coverage for various types of properties, ranging from residential homes to commercial establishments, safeguarding against perils like fire, theft, natural disasters, and more.    However, when it comes to insuring properties in diverse locations such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, Dubai, and Ontario, it becomes evident that a single policy from India cannot adequately address the unique risks and regulatory frameworks associated with each region.    Also read: How to file insurance claims for your damaged cars    Firstly, the geographical and climatic variations between these locations contribute to differing risk profiles. Mumbai, for instance, is prone to cyclones and flooding due to its coastal location. Bengaluru, on the other hand, generally experiences milder climate conditions but is susceptible to water scarcity and occasional hailstorms.    In contrast, Dubai faces extreme heat, sandstorms, and the potential risks associated with rapid urbanisation. Ontario, located in Canada, is subject to harsh winters, snowstorms, and freezing temperatures. Such variations require tailored insurance coverage to address the specific risks prevalent in each area.    Unique nature of property insurance    Unlike health insurance policies that often offer a floater concept, property insurance is issued for a specific property. Each property possesses its own distinct characteristics, including the area, geography, and associated risks.    Therefore, it is not possible to combine multiple properties under a single property insurance policy in India. This is because the risks and requirements associated with each property differ significantly, necessitating the issuance of separate policies.    Also read: Moneycontrol-SecureNow Health Insurance Ratings: How to choose the right health policy    Limitations of geographical coverage    An Indian non-life insurance company holds a licence that restricts its operations to providing property insurance coverage solely for properties situated within the geographical boundaries of India. Consequently, properties located in Dubai or Ontario cannot be insured by this Indian insurer, as they lack authorisation to issue policies for locations outside India.    Each jurisdiction has its own unique legal and regulatory frameworks governing property insurance. Thus, insurance policies must adhere to the local laws and regulations of the respective regions.    For instance, Mumbai and Bengaluru operate under the jurisdiction of Indian laws, while Dubai follows the regulations established by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Ontario abides by Canadian regulations. These regional variations make it impractical to have a single policy originating from India that can effectively meet the legal requirements and nuances of all these regions.    Sourcing coverage from local markets    To ensure adequate coverage for properties in geographies like London, Dubai or Ontario, it is necessary to source insurance from the respective local markets.    Local insurance providers in these regions are equipped with the knowledge and expertise to assess the specific risks associated with properties in their areas. They possess a comprehensive understanding of local regulations, construction practices, and environmental factors that affect insurance coverage and premium calculations.    Why separate policies are essential    By issuing separate policies for each property, insurers can tailor coverage based on the unique risk profiles of individual properties. This allows for precise evaluation of risk factors and appropriate premium calculations. Additionally, it ensures that claims and compensation processes are streamlined, as each property is treated separately in the event of a loss or damage.    Benefits of local market coverage    Obtaining property insurance coverage from local markets has several advantages. Firstly, local insurers possess an in-depth understanding of the regional risks and can offer specialised coverage to mitigate these risks effectively. They also have established relationships with local service providers, facilitating prompt claim settlement and efficient restoration processes.    Moreover, local insurers are well-versed in the legal and regulatory frameworks governing insurance in their respective regions. This ensures compliance with local laws and regulations, providing policyholders with added confidence and security.    Property insurance plays a vital role in safeguarding our assets from unexpected events. However, it is important to recognise the limitations of property insurance policies, particularly in terms of geographical coverage. Understanding that separate policies are necessary for each property and seeking coverage from local markets for properties located outside India is crucial.    By adhering to these principles, policyholders can ensure comprehensive coverage that aligns with the unique characteristics and risks associated with their properties, thereby providing them with peace of mind and financial security.

If you are a student headed to your study institution abroad, by now, you probably have all the paperwork &ndash; Visa, admission and loan formalities &ndash; in place already.    To listen to the podcast, click above. To read the podcast conversation, scroll down.    However, your plan can be considered foolproof only after you buy insurance against the risks that you might encounter during your journey. No one wants to consider the possibility of falling sick, losing expensive gadgets or crucial documents while travelling or after reaching the destination country, but these risks cannot be wished away.    Also read: Why students going abroad need an overseas travel insurance cover    Most universities overseas insist on students being covered under health insurance policies. Some also encourage students to opt for covers offered by local insurers once they reach the campuses.    However, even if it is not mandated, you must ensure that you purchase an international student travel insurance policy offered by Indian general insurers before you leave the country's shores.    Your university-recommended policy can come to your aid once you reach the campus, but an overseas travel policy will take care of risks such as loss of baggage or laptop and trip cancellation or flight delay that may crop up during your journey.    Moneycontrol spoke to Amit Chhabra, Chief Business Officer, Travel Insurance, Policybazaar.com to understand the importance of buying these policies, nitty-gritties, choosing between university-recommended health covers and overseas student policies offered by Indian insurers.    Here are some key pointers that emerged out of the discussion:    - August and September typically see a lot of students flying out, as September semester typically sees a large intake, particularly in the US.    - As against business or leisure travel, which offer coverage for a maximum of 180 days, an overseas student travel policy offers longer-term insurance.    - This is important because unlike business or leisure travellers, students have to stay in their destination countries for one to five years, depending on the courses they have signed up for.    - Another big difference is that regular travel policies are primarily meant to cover emergency situations (for instance, a stroke that needs immediate medical attention). Student travel insurance policies are more comprehensive.    - They will not only pay for medical expenses incurred if you, say, contract a viral infection or have to undergo dental treatment but also for loss of laptop and study interruptions due to emergency at home or violence in the city where your university is located, for instance.    - It is like your long-term companion during your stay abroad &ndash; a health insurance policy with additional benefits such as sponsor protection, compassionate visit, study interruption, coverage for legal expenses if the need arises and so on.    - You can buy an international student insurance policy online even a couple of days before you fly out, but ideally, you should do it at least a week prior.    Also read: Studying abroad? Be aware of these 5 additional costs linked to your education    - It is a serious subject and premiums are not cheap, so you ought to do a  thorough comparison before you choose a policy.    - A student travelling to Europe and choosing a $500,000-cover will have to pay a premium of Rs 23,000 for two years, while the premium for a sum insured of $100,000 would be Rs 14,000.    - The difference in premiums is not exorbitant. So, ideally, you should look to buy policies with maximum sum insured, budget permitting.    - Understand the sub-limits and deductibles. For instance, even if you buy a $500,000-policy, the coverage for baggage loss could be limited to $500 or $1000, for instance.    - Likewise, there could be deductibles. For instance, if the dental treatment cover is $500, you might have to shell out $50 from your pocket before the insurance company chips in with the balance.    - Universities abroad encourage students to buy health insurance from local insurers they might have tied up with. However, they typically do not make it mandatory to buy covers from such partnered insurers    - Buying overseas student travel policies offered by Indian insurers is a better idea for two reasons. One, they are rupee-denominated and not foreign-currency denominated unlike university-recommended covers and hence, cheaper. Some sample (university-recommended plans) that we have seen are 2-3 times costlier than Indian travel policies.    - Secondly, university-recommended plans are essentially health insurance policies that cover illness and accidents.    - Overseas student travel policies, on the other hand, offer additional covers such as baggage loss, passport loss, trip cancellation, flight delay, personal liability and study interruption.    Article 4 - Headline: Equity fund inflows dip 12 % in July, SIPs top Rs 15,000 crore for first time    Open-ended equity mutual funds recorded a 12 percent decline in net inflow to Rs 7,626 crore in July as large-cap funds continued to grapple with outflows, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) released on August 9, showed.    Despite this, Indian investors remained disciplined in their investment approach with inflows into Systematic Investments Plans (SIPs) topping the Rs 15,000 crore for the first time ever, to touch Rs 15,245 crore during July against Rs 14,735 crore in June.    Despite the marginal fall in equity fund investments, net inflows remained in the positive territory for the 29th month in a row in July amid a bull run in the equity markets. In July, the BSE benchmark Sensex scaled 2.80 percent, while NSE Nifty 50 climbed 2.94 percent.    N. S. Venkatesh, Chief Executive, AMFI, said, \"The surge in retail investors' interest in mutual funds has translated into impressive inflows across scheme categories. The star performer this month has been SIP with an impressive 33.06 lakh new accounts registered and a record Rs 15,245 crores of monthly contribution.

The overall assets under management (AUM) of open-ended mutual funds increased 4.50 percent to Rs 46.11 trillion in July from Rs 44,12 trillion in the previous month.    Bullish on small-caps    The net inflows into equity mutual funds were also driven by five new fund offers (NFOs), which cumulatively collected net assets worth Rs 3,011 crore during July.    \"The drop in net inflow in July from June could be attributed to some investors booking a profit with markets trading near all-time highs.

Indian investors have been investing in both the mid-cap and small-cap categories for a couple of years. The last time these funds suffered net outflows was in February 2021 and September 2021, respectively.    On the other hand, large cap-oriented categories witnessed net outflows to the tune of Rs 1,880 crore.        \"Large cap segment has delivered good performance in recent times providing investors a good profit-booking opportunity. Investors would have also chosen to prefer currently performing mid and small-cap funds over large-cap funds,\" said Srivastava.    Debt makes a strong comeback    After witnessing a net outflow of Rs 14,135 crore in June, (the end of the quarter), debt-oriented schemes received a robust net inflow of Rs 61,400 crore in July.

Srivastava added, \"Given the current interest rate scenario and uncertainty over the direction of interest rates in the country, it appears that many investors chose to stay cautious and continue to invest in categories with one year or less maturity profile, since they carry relatively lesser interest rate risk.\"    Gold funds shine    Domestic gold exchange-traded funds saw net inflows of Rs 456 crore in July. On a year-to-date basis, inflows into the category stand at Rs 453.55 crore.

Article 3 - Headline: Analyst Call Tracker | Banks dare margin pressure, dominate optimism list    Banking stocks featured prominently in analysts' buy calls last month as robust credit demand, rising interest income, and stable asset quality boosted their investment profiles.    Domestic banks have posted a strong set of numbers for Q1 FY24, with 30-100 percent growth in net profit, mostly in line with the estimates of brokerage firms.    HDFC Bank, which completed the merger with HDFC last month, had 45 buy calls, one hold and zero sell calls, as per Moneycontrol's Analyst Call Tracker for July.        The country's largest private sector bank on July 17 reported a net profit of Rs 11,951 crore for the April-June quarter, a jump of 30 percent from Rs 9,196 crore last year.    Net interest income (NII) - the difference between the interest earned on loans and paid to depositors - grew by 21.1 percent to Rs 23,599 crore from Rs 19,481 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Total deposits stood at Rs 19.13 lakh crore, up 19.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.    \"Gross advances and deposits will continue to show robust growth in the foreseeable future, with a focus on higher retail participation. The merger unlocks significant synergies for the merged entity, including, but not limited to, lower cost of funds, access to HDFC's sturdy housing loan portfolio and possibilities of cross-selling other financial products to its expanded customer base,\" analysts at domestic brokerage firm Geojit said.    More Analyst Trackers: LTIMindtree, newest entrant to Nifty 50 league, slips into bear zone    Winner Takes It All    The country's largest lender SBI has the maximum &lsquo;buy' calls on the list at 47, followed by Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.    SBI posted its highest-ever quarterly earnings at Rs 16,884 crore, soaring 178 percent on-year, though net interest income came in below estimates at Rs 38,905 crore.    \"Loan growth sustained across segments, led by continued traction in retail assets (especially Xpress Credit book) and the SME portfolio, which benefited from a gradual pick-up in the investment cycle,\" HDFC Securities said in a note to clients.    Axis Bank on July 26 reported a net profit of Rs 5,790 crore for the quarter ended April-June FY24, growing by 40 percent from Rs 4,125 crore last year.    The lender's net interest income (NII) grew 27 percent on a year-on-year (YOY) basis to Rs 11,959 crore, while net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter stood at 4.10 percent, up 50 bps YOY.    ICICI Bank reported a 39.7 percent on-year growth in standalone profit at Rs 9,648 crore for the quarter despite elevated provisions and contingencies.    Net interest income increased by 38 percent on-year to Rs 18,227 crore with net interest margin expansion of 77 bps on-year at 4.78 percent, while loan growth was 18.1 percent and deposits grew by 17.9 percent YoY.    Asset quality was stable with gross NPA falling 5 bps sequentially to 2.76 percent and net NPA flat at 0.48 percent for the quarter.    \"The bank has the highest earnings certainty over the next three years. Net interest margin (NIM) moderation has been in-line and deposit accretion has picked up pace. Core pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) was reported 37 percent higher YoY and the bank will invest in growth in FY24,\" brokerage firm CLSA said.    Margin Pressures    While banks had a standout quarter overall, when looked at sequentially, the numbers reveal some stress on the margins front.    For example, the net interest income for SBI declined 4 percent QoQ, led by a sharp 27 bps QoQ decline in net interest margin to 3.33 percent. Axis Bank's NIMs moderated 12 bps sequentially.    Analysts say catch-up in funding costs following accelerated funds mobilisation is expected to squeeze margins and weigh on banks' balance sheets in the near-term.    Banks will have to hike interest rates further to chase depositors, and on the other hand, the loan book has been largely repriced as more than half of it is linked to external benchmark lending rate (EBLR).    On the advances side, while banks are chasing retail borrowers, corporate loan offtake is still subdued.    \"Banks saw strong margin delivery in FY23, benefiting from lead/lag of asset-liability re-pricing, consumption of internal liquidity and lower NPA formation. However, we believe that the on-balance-sheet liquidity has been largely consumed, while higher deposit growth coupled with the lagging repricing should catch up, leading to margin softness in FY24 for most banks,\" analysts at Emkay Global said.    It believes the rate hike cycle is largely behind, thus, managing the liability cost becomes vital for protecting margins. \"That said, a few banks with lower loan-to-deposit ratio (such as SBI) or higher share of MCLR (Indian Bank) to be repriced should be able to protect their margins or witness relatively lesser correction. Also, banks with a higher fixed-rate asset book, coupled with a reasonable CASA base, should see margin expansion, once the rate cycle reverses,\" it said.

At 9.10 am, the home currency was trading at 82.80 to a dollar, down 0.06 percent from its previous close.    Traders turn cautious as the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy committee begins its meeting, the outcome of which will be shared on August 10. They also await July's CPI inflation data and industrial and manufacturing production data for June, which will be released on August 11.    \"With domestic fundamentals remaining robust, the rupee is likely to face tough resistance around the 82.80-83.00 zone and the upcoming sessions could see the pair falling back below the 82.50 territory. Hence, we suggest exporters not get complacent and importers not panic as overall biases of the USDINR pair remain on the downside,\" CR Forex said in a note.    Globally, attention would shift to inflation data emanating from the world's two largest economies, the US and China. The US Producer Price Index (PPI), too, would be watched closely.    Asian currencies traded weak as the dollar gained ahead of a crucial US CPI data to be released on August 10. The Japanese yen fell 0.54 percent, the South Korean won 0.5 percent, while the Philippine peso, the Malaysian ringgit and the Thai Baht declined 0.3 percent each. The Indonesian rupiah and China Offshore were down 0.25 percent each, while the Singapore dollar and the Taiwanese dollar each traded 0.17 percent down.    The dollar index, which measures the US currency's strength against major currencies, was trading at 102.29, up 0.23 percent from its previous close of 102.05.    (with Bloomberg inputs)    &amp;nbsp;    Article 2 - Headline: Rupee closes higher against US dollar    The rupee ended marginally higher after falling for the fourth straight session with the dollar losing its charm after mixed US jobs data on Friday.    The Indian currency ended at 82.75 to a dollar, up 0.11 percent from its previous close of 82.84. The rupee opened at 82.72 to a dollar.    The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy meeting is scheduled from August 8-10. Additionally, the CPI inflation for July, industrial production, and manufacturing production data for June will be released on August 11.    Globally, during this week, the market's attention has shifted towards inflation data emanating from the world's two largest economies, namely the US and China. Subsequently, all eyes will be on the US Producer Price Index (PPI) as well.    \"Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) flows and the RBI's persistent pressure on the USD may shape the currency's performance, making it less likely for the rupee to depreciate beyond the 82.80-90 range. The prevailing sentiment suggests a potential move towards the 82.20-82.00 mark, indicating a degree of stability in the currency's outlook. In this context, exporters are advised to capitalise on any potential upticks in the dollar-rupee and explore selling opportunities, while importers are encouraged to exercise caution and wait for suitable hedging options,\" said Amit Pabri of CR Forex in a note to investors.    Asian currencies were trading mixed on August 7. The South Korean won gained 0.67 percent, the Philippines peso 0.16 percent, and the Taiwan dollar climbed 0.08 percent. Among losers, China's Renminbi lost 0.26 percent, the Japanese yen 0.24 percent, and the Thai Baht 0.06 percent.    The dollar index, which measures the US currency's strength against major currencies, was trading at 102, down 0.06 percent from its previous close of 102.02.    With inputs from Reuters    Article 3 - Headline: Rupee sinks to a month's low against the dollar in the opening trade    The Indian rupee dropped to one-month low against the US dollar in the opening trade on August 2 amid rising crude prices and weak Asian currencies. A growing dollar demand and concerns over foreign outflows amid volatile local equities added to the weakness.    Global markets fell as negative sentiment after credit rating agency Fitch Ratings downgraded the US credit rating from AAA to AA+. This decision was driven by concerns over the anticipated fiscal deterioration in the US economy over the next three years.    At 11.07 am, the rupee was trading at 82.48 a dollar, down 0.16 percent from its previous close. The currency hit a low of 82.49 -- a level last seen on 10 July.    Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on August 2, trading near their highest since April after industry data showed a steeper-than-expected draw last week in oil inventories in the US, the world's biggest fuel consumer, news agency Reuters reported.    Foreign investors have sold shares worth Rs 5,700 crore over the past four sessions.    \"(The rupee weakened) due to rising dollar demand as concerns start to brew over the possibility of potential outflows of Russian funds held in rupees with local banks,\" CR Forex said in its latest note.    Amid the Western sanctions that restrict Russia from using the US dollar for trade, India paid in other currencies, including the dirham, yuan, and rupee, which local banks hold in special accounts, it said.    However, since Indian imports exceeded exports, Russian companies accumulated billions of rupees that the RBI has allowed to be invested in local government bonds. \"Well, the markets have been worried about the eventual outflows of these funds which could lead to a rise in FX volatility\", the report added.    Asian currencies were trading weak against the dollar as well. The South Korean won fell 0.84 percent, the Malaysian ringgit 0.46 percent, the Indonesian rupiah 0.34 percent, the Philippines peso 0.31 percent, the Taiwan dollar 0.22 percent, the Thai Baht 0.22 percent, while China Offshore lost 0.08 percent.    The dollar index, which measures the US currency's strength against major currencies, was trading at 102.21, down 0.09 percent from its previous close of 102.30.    (with Bloomberg inputs)    Article 4 - Headline: Rupee opens in red at 82.33 against dollar in step with loss in Asian currencies    The rupee opened weaker against the US dollar tracking losses in the Asian currency markets.    At 9.10am, the currency was trading at 82.33 a dollar, down 0.1 percent from its previous close of 82.25.    Crude oil prices jumped again after Chinese manufacturing PMI data released on Monday was lower than expected and increased chances of Chinese stimulus. Supply cuts from the OPEC+ nations and hopes of increased global oil demands are also supporting crude oil prices.    \"The important factor for us is Brent oil rising to $ 85.15 per barrel on tightening supplies, thus giving our CAD a rise in the coming months as the price of Russian oil rises too. The yen fell to a three week low of 142.66 as traders weighed on BOJs policy shift,\" said Anil Kumar Bhansali Head of Treasury and Executive Director Finrex Treasury Advisors LLP.    Asian currencies were trading weaker. South Korean won fell 0.51 percent, China Offshore lost 0.33 percent, Japanese yen declined 0.27 percent, Taiwan dollar 0.25 percent, Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah fell 0.2 percent each, Singapore dollar 0.11 percent. Among gainers, the Philippines peso gained 0.33 percent.    The dollar index, which measures the US currency's strength against major currencies, was trading at 102.006, up 0.14 percent from its previous close of 101.855.    With Bloomberg inputs    URL: https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodity/    Article 1 - Headline: Varroc Engineering jumps 12% on Q1 profit, debt reduction    Shares of Varroc Engineering Ltd. jumped over 12 percent in early trade on August 10 after the company reported a profit in Q1FY24 against a loss, a year ago.    At 9.30am, the stock was trading at Rs 386 on the BSE, up 12.7 percent from its previous close while India's benchmark Sensex fell 0.3 percent to 65,782 points.    The company posted a net profit of Rs 55 crore in Q1FY24 versus a loss of Rs 39 crore in Q1FY23. This positive shift is attributed to company's robust performances in both domestic and export markets, along with receipt of specific incentives from the government.    Varroc Engineering Ltd.'s revenue jumped 10.4 percent in Q1 from a year ago to Rs 1805.70 crore. EBITDA jumped 34 percent YoY to Rs 180.20 crore while EBITDA margin expanded to 10 percent from 8.2 percent year ago driven by business mix, incentives &amp;amp; operating leverage.    Catch all the market action LIVE    During Q1, the company also announced a reduction in its debt by Rs 50 crore. This reduction in debt has consequently led to a quarter-on-quarter decrease in interest costs.    \"The ongoing monsoon and festive season will be key to watch out for the automobile sector to continue its momentum. The reduction in fame II subsidy from June 1 for EV vehicles impacted EV volumes sharply but we are cautiously optimistic about the recovery in volumes in coming months\", the company said in a notice to the exchange.    \"Our focus will remain to strengthen our competitiveness in India and globally by developing world class products and services. We will enhance and leverage our global footprint as we are a global company with strong roots in India. During the current financial year, our businesses will continue to deliver growth and returns while maintaining strong fiscal discipline\", it added.    Article 2 - Headline: Ratnamani Metals gains 2% after June quarter earnings    Shares of Ratnamani Metals &amp;amp; Tubes Ltd gained over 2 percent after the firm reported 55-percent year-on-year jump in its net profit for June quarter.    At 9.30 am, the stock was trading at Rs 2,620 on BSE, up 2 percent from its previous close while India's benchmark Sensex fell 0.31 percent to 65,794 points.    Net profit for the June quarter stood at Rs 134.86 crore against Rs 48.02 crore a year ago. Revenue rose 20 percent YoY to Rs 1,174.93 crore.    The company recently bought a 53-percent stake in Ravi Technoforge for Rs 98 crore. There are also plans in place to further raise its stake by an additional 27 percent during the fiscal year 2025. The company's order book has seen substantial expansion, reaching a value of Rs 3,100 crore, with a major portion attributed to Domestic Carbon Steel Pipes.    Future plans    Ratnamani Metals specialises in the manufacturing of two primary product categories: Stainless Steel Tubes and Carbon Steel Pipes. Within the Stainless Steel segment, there are seamless tubes and welded tubes, while the Carbon Steel Pipes business encompasses Electric Resistance Welded (ERW), HSAW, and Longitudinal Submerged Arc-Welding Pipe (LSAW) pipes.    During a conversation with CNBC-TV18, Manoj Sanghvi, the Business Unit Head at Ratnamani Metals and Tubes, shared that the company has set its revenue projection at Rs 4,200 crore for the ongoing financial year. Looking ahead, the company aims for a 10 percent revenue growth in the subsequent financial year. With a vision extending to 2025, Ratnamani Metals envisions achieving a revenue milestone of Rs 6,000 crore, a goal they believe is attainable, contingent upon prevailing market conditions.    Article 3 - Headline: Oil prices fall as China woes offset boost from high US fuel demand    Oil prices fell in early Asian trade on Thursday after reaching fresh highs in the previous session as concerns about the Chinese economy offset the positive impact of steep drawdowns in U.S. fuel stockpiles and Saudi and Russian output cuts.    Brent crude fell 20 cents, or 0.2%, to $87.35 a barrel by 0006 GMT, after settling at its highest since Jan. 27 in the previous session.    West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 23 cents, or 0.3%, to $84.17, after settling at its highest since November 2022.    Chinese data on Tuesday showed crude oil imports in July fell 18.8% from the previous month to their lowest daily rate since January.    China's consumer sector also fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand.    However, prices were supported by government data on Wednesday that showed that U.S. gasoline stocks fell by 2.7 million barrels last week, while distillate inventories, which include diesel and heating oil, dropped by 1.7 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for both to hold mostly steady. [EIA/S]    Also supporting prices were top exporter Saudi Arabia's plans to extend its voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels per day for another month to include September. Russia also said it would cut oil exports by 300,000 bpd in September.    Investors were also awaiting July's U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), due on Thursday, which is expected to show a slight year-over-year acceleration.    URL: https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/    Article 1 - Headline: Does money win the war - Inferences from the Russian push in defence expenditure    As the Russia-Ukraine war continues unabated, both countries are exploring ways and means to gain an upper hand. The latest is the so-called quantum jump in Russia's defence expenditure (defex). According to a recent Reuters report, Russia has nearly doubled its defex target to more than $102 billion in the current year. The announcement is not surprising since Russia is on a spending spree to finance its war activities and has apparently spent the allocated budget by June this year. However, it is debatable if a quantum jump alone would enable Russia to gain a decisive advantage over Ukraine.    War-led Spending    According to the 2023 SIPRI Factsheet on Trends in Military Expenditure, Russia emerged as the third largest spender (from fifth in 2021) after the US and China, spending more than $86 billion and accounting for 4.1 percent of its GDP in 2022. SIPRI data, therefore, is at variance with Reuter's claim, since there is an increase of only 20 percent over last year's figures. Hitherto, Russia is an autocratic, militarised state with overgrown military establishments, perpetual warfare, high-level military mobilisation and a consequential larger share for the military in resource allocation. For example, in 2022, only seven countries allocated more defex as a proportion of GDP than Russia. Further, Russia continues to monetise some portions of oil exports and, therefore, would most likely sustain the revenue model for its war activities and allocate even higher portions of GDP to defence in future.    However, Ukraine has also pushed up its defex. It moved from the 36th position in 2021 to the 11th in 2022, spending $44 billion. This was a 640 percent increase over its 2021 defex figures. A balance of fortunes would possibly emerge only if there is a huge asymmetry between the two countries. That is not happening since Ukraine was also able to raise a significant amount through military assistance and loans from NATO countries. The US, for example, has committed more than $40 billion in security assistance alone since February 2022. Another $35 billion stands committed for humanitarian and financial aid. A matching contribution has also been committed by the European Union institutions and non-US NATO members. Therefore, Russian defex increases are meaningless.    Money Just One Factor    Hitherto, money is only one of the numerous factors in warfare. For example, America's defence budget is 39 percent of the global defence expenditure and is three times more than China, the next in the pecking order. Yet, America has not been able to win any war in recent times after the 1991 Gulf War success. Saudi Arabia is the fifth-largest military spender and is either the largest or second-largest importer of weapons in the international arms market. Yet, Saudi Arabia has failed to metamorphose itself into a recognised military power in the Gulf and West Asia region. It emerges, therefore, that there are significant non-monetary factors that decide the fate of contemporary wars.    Unfortunately, Russia has many such problems that undermine the budgetary increases. First, Russia does not have a conducive military culture for carrying out successful war activities. Years of combat experience notwithstanding, Russian soldiers are fatigued. While Russia has an advanced military-industrial complex (MIC) and has been a lead arms supplier, the personnel side of military modernisation remains in shambles. Soldiers are not getting paid in time and efforts to push up military reforms were never taken seriously. The military leadership is uninspiring, best evident in the open revolt by a private army against them some time ago.    Hurt By Sanctions    Second, Russia's supply chain economy for delivering quantitative and qualitative military hardware is increasingly coming under challenge. From being an arms exporter, Russia is now desperate to import vital spare parts for its arsenals. Its domestic MIC is not able to produce many of those items despite liberal budgetary support and manpower training in weapons production. Part of the reason is the tightening of global economic sanctions on Russia and its extermination from all international arms markets.    Third, despite being an established military power, Russia is not able to come out with disruptive military innovations or technologies to gain a significant advantage over Ukraine. Its Air Force failed to make a decisive dent into Ukraine's air space. The missile forces too have not made any significant damage after early impact. Russia, it seems, is a victim of overconfidence and poor strategic instincts. On the contrary, Ukraine has won back sizeable portions of territory from the Russian military. In recent times, it has taken the war to Russian territory, hitting portions of Moscow and sea ports in drone attacks from far-off distances.    Contemporary wars are protracted wars. Even great powers are not able to clinch an outright victory. In uncertain war atmospherics, overt emphasis on defence spending is more about politics and marketing than an effective tool in war economy management. Therefore, it is debatable if defex increases alone will induce favourable military fortunes for Russia. At best, it would perpetuate Russia's military economy without ensuring a decisive outcome in the ongoing war against Ukraine.    Bhartendu Kumar Singh is in the Indian Defence Accounts Service.

Article 2 - Headline: Live: EU declares July hottest month | RBI MPC today | Kareena Kapoor invests in Pluckk | Newspresso        Article 3 - Headline: Joe Biden narrows China investment order as US seeks better ties    President Joe Biden imposed limits on US investments in China as part of a push to restrict the country's ability to develop next-generation military and surveillance technologies that might threaten US national security.    The order, announced Wednesday, would regulate US investments in some Chinese semiconductor, quantum computing and artificial intelligence firms.    It was signed after almost two years of deliberations that saw China hawks argue for faster, tougher action while others, including the Treasury Department, sought narrower measures that would take longer to go into effect.    While details of the rules still need to be worked out, the language of the order suggested that Treasury and those advocating a more cautious approach won out.    The order, which won't go into effect until next year, won't be retroactive and excludes sectors such as biotechnology. It may end up exempting passive investments as well as those in publicly traded securities, index funds and others assets.    \"For the business community, this is relatively good news,\" said Sarah Bauerle Danzman, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and associate professor of international studies at Indiana University. \"It's a relatively narrow notification process and very narrow set of prohibitions.\"    Targeting Equity  Venture-capital firms and the tech industry had lobbied the Biden administration to narrow the scope of the order, after investors feared the White House would impose sweeping limits on US investment. Allied nations had also resisted, with the European Union and others saying that severe restrictions could hurt their economies.    Biden administration officials said the order targets those who look to acquire equity interests in restricted Chinese companies via mergers, private equity and private capital, as well as by joint ventures and financing arrangements. It's expected to be limited to Chinese startups and larger firms that get over 50% of their revenue from the restricted sectors.    Bloomberg Economics: Yards, Fences and Biden's New China Investment Rules    The US already limits exports of some sensitive technologies to China, and the order \"would prevent U.S. investments from helping accelerate the indigenization of these technologies\" in what it called countries of concern, the White House said in a release. The order defined that as China, Hong Kong and Macau.    &lsquo;Very Disappointed'  China is \"very disappointed\" in the US decision to go ahead with the restrictions and will safeguard its own interests, Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement.    \"China opposes the US overuse of national security to politicize and weaponize trade, scientific and technological issues and deliberately making obstacles to normal economic and trade exchanges and technological cooperation,\" Liu said.    The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing later called on Washington to respect market principles and fair play instead of obstructing the global economic recovery.    The restrictions are the latest in a series of US actions that have complicated the Biden administration's push to improve relations with China, after a succession of flare-ups over Taiwan, rights abuses in Xinjiang, intellectual property threats, and an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down in February.    Not least among the irritants have been export controls on semiconductor technology announced last year and efforts by Congress to push the White House toward taking a harder line, including on defending Taiwan.    Low-Key Rollout  The White House announced the order after US markets closed Wednesday, but reaction was expected to be muted. Major US investors had anticipated it for some time, and venture-capital firms had already been scaling back their bets on Chinese startups for well over a year.    A relatively low-key rollout on Wednesday showcased how cautious the White House is about ratcheting up tensions with China. Instead of announcing it in the presence of media and giving public remarks on the matter - as is often the case for executive orders - Biden opted to sign it while out of town and without cameras. The president was traveling in New Mexico to promote his \"Bidenomics\" agenda and didn't address the order.    Biden in May predicted a \"thaw\" was coming in US-China relations, which over the past year have deteriorated to their worst in decades. The president also said repeatedly that he plans to speak to and meet with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, in the near future. The two leaders could meet in November when Biden hosts the APEC summit in San Francisco, but neither side has confirmed the plans.    Allies, Businesses  A key question now is whether other countries will follow Washington's move, including fellow Group of Seven countries. The administration has briefed allies and partners about the order over the past year, arguing that it must be done in coordination with them to avoid the backfilling of curtailed US investments. So far, none have followed through.    A UK government spokesperson said the order helps clarify the US approach to China and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government will consider it closely.    A fact sheet that accompanied the announcement underscored how much of the order remains a work in progress. It said, for example, the Treasury was \"considering\" the prohibition of investments in technologies that remained loosely defined, with more specific definitions subject to input the Treasury will gather during a 45-day comment period.    Daniel Tannebaum, partner at Oliver Wyman, said that the release of the EO is just the start of the process and gives businesses plenty of time to weigh in on how the restrictions will ultimately work.    \"We're not done yet,\" Tannebaum said. \"We need to see what this ultimately looks like but it's encouraging that they're giving industry a chance to weigh in on a whole host of topics.\"    Courting Congress  White House officials briefed Republican and Democratic staff on Capitol Hill about the order earlier on Wednesday, and the initial response was tepid, according to one GOP staffer who joined the discussions and asked not to be identified because the briefing was private.    Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, said the order was essential but \"cannot be the final step.\" House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said the failure to include existing investments and the decision to exclude sectors such as biotechnology were concerning.    \"The administration scaling back - at a time where aggressive action is needed more than ever - continues the trend of appeasing industry at the cost of national security,\" McCaul said in a statement.    Article 4 - Headline: Sony shares slide after earnings highlight concern about games, sensors    Shares in Japan's Sony fell 6% in Tokyo trade after first-quarter profit tumbled, with the entertainment conglomerate reporting lacklustre performances by its movie and financial divisions.    Operating profit slid 31% and comments by Sony executives over demand for its games and image sensors units also sparked concern.    The PlayStation 5 console launched in late 2020 but supply was badly affected by supply chain problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite an easing of those snarls, Sony said sales of were below expectations in the April-June quarter. It is targeting sales of 25 million units for the full year.    Sony sold 3.3 million PS5 units in quarter. By comparison, Nintendo's Switch console, which is in its seventh year on the market, sold 3.9 million units in the same period as consumers rushed to play the latest \"Zelda\" title.    Sony said promotions that began are July are improving sales momentum for the PS5.    \"Sony started discounting the PS5 in the West, which is never a good sign,\" said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy.    \"The company has a lot of work to do, first and foremost to make sure those blockbuster first-party games come out quicker.\"    \"Marvel's Spider-Man 2\" is due for release in October ahead of the key year-end shopping season. Its predecessor has sold more than 13 million units.    Sony, a leading maker of image sensors used in cameras, also revised down its expectations for a gradual recovery in the smartphone market, saying it now does not expect one until 2024 at the earliest due to weak demand in major markets.    The company trimmed cut its annual operating profit forecast for the unit by 10%, citing the impact of lower sales.    Adjustment to procurement by smartphone manufacturers is having a large impact in the second quarter, Sony said.    The current financial year \"will be tough\" for the sensors division, Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note, adding that higher margins are expected in the following year.   \n"
